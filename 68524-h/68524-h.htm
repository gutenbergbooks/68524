<small>VALERIA AND OWEN QUENTILLIAN</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>(i)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ship swung slowly away from the side of the
wharf. Several people on board then said, “Well,
we’re off at last!” to several other people who had only
been thinking of saying it.</p>

<p>Owen Quentillian remembered another, longer, sea-voyage
taken by himself at an early age. Far more
clearly he remembered his arrival at St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>It was that which he wanted to recall, aware as he
was of the necessity for resuming a connection that
had almost insensibly lapsed for several years.</p>

<p>He deliberately let his mind travel backwards,
visualizing himself, a disconsolate, shivering morsel,
being taken away from Papa and Mamma at the very
station itself, and put into an open pony-cart beside
Miss Lucilla Morchard.</p>

<p>The conversation between them, as far as he could
recollect it, had run upon strangely categorical lines.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m Canon Morchard’s daughter. You can call me
Lucilla.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m fifteen, but you shouldn’t ask grown-up persons
their age.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you a grown-up person?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“Of course I am. My mother is dead, and I look
after the house and the children, and now I’m going
to look after you as well.”</p>

<p>Lucilla had smiled very nicely as she said this.</p>

<p>“How many children are there?”</p>

<p>“Three, at home. My eldest brother is at school.”</p>

<p>“What are the names of the other ones?”</p>

<p>“Valeria and Flora and Adrian. Valeria and Flora
are sometimes called Val and Flossie.”</p>

<p>He had discovered afterwards that they were seldom
called anything else, except by their father.</p>

<p>“Why don’t Papa and Mamma come in this little
carriage too?”</p>

<p>“Because there wouldn’t have been room. They
will come in the brougham, later on.”</p>

<p>“They won’t go back to India without saying good-bye
first, will they?” he asked wistfully.</p>

<p>He had known for a long time that Papa and Mamma
were going back to India and leaving him at St.
Gwenllian.</p>

<p>“No, I promise you they won’t do that,” had said
Lucilla seriously.</p>

<p>Owen had felt entirely that her word was one to be
relied upon. Very few grown-up persons gave him
that feeling.</p>

<p>He remembered extraordinarily little about the house
at St. Gwenllian. It was large, and cold, and there
were a good many pictures on the walls, but the only
two rooms of which he retained a mental photograph
were the schoolroom, and the Canon’s library.</p>

<p>He saw the latter room first.</p>

<p>Lucilla had taken him there at once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>He remembered the books against the wall—numbers
and numbers of books—and the big black writing
table, with a small bowl of violets next to a pile of
papers, and above the writing-table a finely-carved
ivory figure, crucified upon a wooden cross, set in a
long plaque of pale-green velvet.</p>

<p>Lucilla had seemed to be disappointed because her
father was out.</p>

<p>“He said he did so want to be here to welcome
you himself, but he is always very busy. Some one
sent for him, I think.”</p>

<p>The youthful Owen Quentillian had cared less than
nothing for the non-appearance of his future host and
tutor. The prospect of the schoolroom tea had touched
him more nearly.</p>

<p>But the schoolroom tea had turned out to be a sort
of nightmare.</p>

<p>Even now, he could hardly smile at the recollection
of that dreadful meal.</p>

<p>Eventually Val and Flossie had resolved themselves
into good-natured, cheerful little girls, and Adrian into
a slightly spoilt and rather precocious little boy, addicted
to remarks of the type hailed as “wonderful”
in the drawing-room and “affected humbug” in the
schoolroom.</p>

<p>But on that first evening, Val and Flossie had been
two monsters with enormous eyes that stared disapprovingly,
all the time, straight at Owen Quentillian
and nobody else. Adrian had been an utterly incomprehensible,
rather malignant little creature, who had
asked questions.</p>

<p>“Can you see colours for each day of the week?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Quentillian wondered whether he had looked as much
alarmed as he had felt, in his utter bewilderment.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> think Monday is blue, and Tuesday light green,
and Wednesday dark green,” Adrian had then proclaimed,
triumphantly, and casting his big brown eyes
about as though to make sure that his three sisters
had heard the enunciation of his strange creed.</p>

<p>“Adrian is not a bit like other little boys,” one of
them had then said, with calm pride.</p>

<p>Owen Quentillian, unconscious of irony, had ardently
hoped that she spoke truly.</p>

<p>Adrian had pinched him surreptitiously during tea,
and had laughed in a way that made Owen flush when
they had asked him what India was like and he had
answered “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>He had thought the thick bread-and-butter nasty,
and wondered if there was never any cake. A vista of
past teas, with sugared cakes from the drawing-room,
especially selected by himself, and brought to his own
little table on the back veranda by the Ayah, made him
choke.</p>

<p>There had been a dreadful moment when he had
snatched at the horrid mug they had given him and
held it before his face for a long, long time, desperately
pretending to drink, and not daring to show his face.</p>

<p>Lucilla, seated at the head of the table, had offered
the others more tea, but she had said nothing to the
little strange boy, and he still felt grateful to her.</p>

<p>The miserable, chaotic jumble that was all that his
mind retained, of interminable slices of bread-and-butter
that tasted like sawdust, of thick, ugly white
china, of hostile or mocking gazes, of jokes and allusions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
in which he had no share, all came to a sudden
end when he had given up any hope of ever being happy
again so long as he lived.</p>

<p>Canon Morchard had come into the room.</p>

<p>And, magically, Val and Flossie had turned into
quiet, insignificant little girls, looking gently and trustfully
at their father, and no longer staring curiously
at Owen Quentillian, and Adrian had become a wide-eyed,
guileless baby, and the thick bread-and-butter
and the ugly china no longer existed at all.</p>

<p>Only Lucilla had undergone no transformation.</p>

<p>She said “This is Owen Quentillian, Father,” in a
matter-of-fact tone of voice.</p>

<p>“I know, my child, I know.”</p>

<p>His hand, large and protecting, had grasped the
boy’s hand, and after a moment he stooped and put
his lips gently to Owen’s forehead.</p>

<p>Quentillian remembered a presence of general benignity,
a strangely sweet smile that came, however, very
rarely, a deep voice, and an effect of commanding
height and size.</p>

<p>Memory could not recapture any set form of words,
but Quentillian endeavoured, whimsically, to recast
certain speeches which he felt to be permeated with
the spirit of the Canon.</p>

<p>“My dear little boy, I hope you may come to feel
this as home. We shall all of us endeavour to make
it so. Lucilla here is my little housekeeper—ask her
for anything that you want. Valeria—my tomboy.
She and you will have some grand romps together.
Flora is younger; nearer your own age, perhaps. Flora
plays the piano, and we hope that she may show great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
feeling for Art, by and bye. Little Adrian, I am sure,
has already made friends with you. I call him the
Little Friend of all the World. There are some very
quaint fancies under this brown mop, but we shall
make something out of them one of these days—one
of these days.”</p>

<p>Some such introduction there had certainly been.
The Canon had been nothing if not categorical, and
Quentillian could fancifully surmise in him a bewilderment
not untinged with resentment had his Valeria
one day tired of being a tomboy, and elected to patronize
the piano, or Flora suddenly become imbued with
a romping spirit, to the detriment of her artistic
propensities.</p>

<p>But the Canon’s children had always refrained from
any <i>volte-face</i> calculated to disconcert their parent.
Quentillian was almost sure that all of them, except
Lucilla, had been afraid of him—even Adrian, on
whom his father had lavished a peculiar cherishing
tenderness.</p>

<p>Quentillian could remember certain sharp, stern rebukes,
called forth by Valeria’s tendency to untimely
giggles, or Flora’s infantile tears, or his own occasional
sulks and obstinacy under the new <i>régime</i>. But he
could only once remember Adrian in disgrace, and so
abysmal had been the catastrophe, that imagination
was unneeded for recalling it clearly.</p>

<p>Adrian had told a lie.</p>

<p>Quentillian re-lived the terrible episode.</p>

<p>“Which of you children took a message for me
from Radly yesterday? Not you, Lucilla?”</p>

<p>“No, father.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Mrs. Radly died last night.” The Canon’s face was
suffused. “She asked for me all yesterday, and Radly
actually left her in order to find some way of sending
me a message. I hear now that he met ‘one of the
St. Gwenllian children’ and sent an urgent summons
which was never delivered. <i>Which was never delivered!</i>
Good Heavens, children, think of it! I was here,
in our own home-circle, enjoying a pleasant evening
reading aloud, when that woman was dying there in
the farm, craving for the help and comfort that I, her
shepherd and pastor, could and <i>should</i> have given her.”</p>

<p>He covered his face with his hand and groaned
aloud.</p>

<p>“In all the years of my ministry,” he said slowly,
“I have never had a more bitter blow. And dealt me
by one of my own household! Children,” his voice
boomed suddenly terrible, “which of you received
Radly’s message yesterday?”</p>

<p>Quentillian, in the retrospect, felt no surprise at the
absence of any competition in laying claim to the implied
responsibility.</p>

<p>At last Lucilla said tentatively:</p>

<p>“Val? Flora?”</p>

<p>“I never saw Radly at all, yesterday, nor any other
day,” said Val, her brown eyes wide open and fixed
straight upon her father.</p>

<p>Flora’s little, pretty face was pale and scared.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t me. No one ever gave me any message.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled as though she feared to be disbelieved.</p>

<p>“Owen?” said the Canon sternly.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Adrian?” his voice softened.</p>

<p>“No, father.”</p>

<p>The Canon hardly appeared to listen to Adrian’s
answer. His hand was on the little boy’s brown curls,
in the fond, half-absent, gesture habitual to him.</p>

<p>He faced the children, and his eye rested upon Owen
Quentillian.</p>

<p>“If any one of you,” he said sternly and slowly,
“has been betrayed into telling me a lie, understand
that it is not yet too late for full confession. Selfish
heedlessness cannot be judged by its terrible consequences,
and if I spoke too strongly just now, it was
out of the depths of my own grief and shame. The
forgetfulness was bad—very bad—but that I can forgive.
A lie, I can <i>not</i> forgive. It is not too late.”</p>

<p>His face was white and terrible as he gazed with
strained eyes at the children.</p>

<p>Little Flora began to cry, and Lucilla put her arm
round her.</p>

<p>“Understand me, children, denial is perfectly useless.
I <i>know</i> that message was given to one of you,
and that it was not delivered, and it is simply a question
of hours before I see Radly and obtain from him the
name of the child to whom the message was given. I
accuse no one of you, but I implore the culprit to speak
out. Otherwise,” he hit the table with his clenched
fist, and it seemed as though lightning shot from his
blazing eyes, “otherwise I shall know that there dwells
under my roof a liar and a coward.”</p>

<p>Quentillian could hear still the scorn that rang in
that deep, vibrant voice, terrifying the children.</p>

<p>Not one of them spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>And the Canon had gone out of the room with
anguish in his eyes.</p>

<p>The nursery court-martial that followed was held by
Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Flossie, it couldn’t have been you, because you
stayed in all yesterday with your cold. Owen and Val
were out in the afternoon?”</p>

<p>“We went to see the woman with the new twins,”
said Val, indignantly. “We never met anyone the
whole way, did we, Owen?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Owen Quentillian had known all the time what was
coming. He knew, with the terrible, intimate knowledge
of the nursery, that Adrian was the only one of the
Canon’s children who did not always speak the truth.</p>

<p>Apparently Lucilla, also, knew.</p>

<p>She said “Oh, Adrian,” in a troubled, imploring
voice.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” said Adrian, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“I knew it was Adrian,” said little Flora. “I saw
Radly coming up the lane very fast, I saw him out
of the night-nursery window, and I saw Adrian, too.
I knew it was Adrian, all the time.”</p>

<p>None of the children was surprised.</p>

<p>Adrian, confronted with their take-it-for-granted
attitude, ceased his mechanical denials.</p>

<p>The preoccupation of them all, was Canon Morchard.</p>

<p>“It’ll be less bad if you tell him yourself than if
Radly does,” Owen Quentillian pointed out.</p>

<p>“Of course, it makes it much worse having told him
a lie,” Val said crudely, “but perhaps he didn’t much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
notice what you said. I’m sure he thought it was
Owen, all the time.”</p>

<p>How much better if it had been Owen, if it had
been any one of them, save the Canon’s best-loved child,
his youngest son!</p>

<p>“You must come and tell him at once,” Lucilla decreed—but
not hopefully.</p>

<p>“I can’t. You know what he said about a liar and
a coward under his roof.”</p>

<p>Adrian cried and shivered.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t angry the time I broke the clock,” said
Flora. “He took me on his knee and only just talked
to me. I didn’t mind a bit.”</p>

<p>“But you hadn’t told a story,” said the inexorable
Val.</p>

<p>They all knew that there lay the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>Quentillian could see the circle of scared, perplexed
faces still—Lucilla, troubled, but unastonished, keeping
a vigilant hold on Adrian all the time, Val, frankly
horrified and full of outspoken predictions of the direst
description, Flossie in tears, stroking and fondling
Adrian’s hand with the tenderest compassion. He even
visualized the pale, squarely built, little flaxen-haired
boy that had been himself.</p>

<p>They could not persuade Adrian to confess.</p>

<p>At last Lucilla said: “If you don’t tell him, Adrian,
then I shall.”</p>

<p>And so it had been, because Canon Morchard, re-entering
the schoolroom, had, with a penetration to
which his children were accustomed, instantly perceived
the tears and the terror on Adrian’s face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“What is it, little lad? Have you hurt yourself?”</p>

<p>The kind, unsuspicious concern in his voice, as he
held out his hand!</p>

<p>Quentillian was certain that a pause had followed the
enquiry—Adrian’s opportunity, conceded by Lucilla,
even while she knew, as they all did, that he would take
no advantage of it.</p>

<p>Then Lucilla had told.</p>

<p>Quentillian’s thoughts went off at a tangent, dwelling
for the first time, with a certain surprised admiration,
upon Lucilla’s resolute, almost matter-of-fact performance
of her painful and alarming task.</p>

<p>Canon Morchard had been incredulous at first, and
Lucilla had steadily repeated, and reiterated again and
again, the dreadful truth.</p>

<p>A black time had followed.</p>

<p>It assumed the proportions of a twelve-month, in
the retrospect. Could it have extended over a week?
Strangely enough, Quentillian could not recall the exact
fate of Adrian, but he knew that the Canon first
fulminated words of wrath and scorn, and at last had
actually broken down, tears streaming down his furrowed
face, and that the sight of this unrestrained display
of suffering had caused the boy Owen to creep
from the room, with the strange, sick feeling of one
who had witnessed an indecency.</p>

<p>All the children except Lucilla, who indeed scarcely
counted as one of them, had avoided Canon Morchard
in the ensuing days. They had crept about the house
silently, and at meals no one spoke until the Canon had
left the room. Owen Quentillian, playing with a ball
in the passage and inadvertently bouncing it against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the closed study door, had been suddenly confronted by
the Canon, and the look of grief and horror fixed
upon that handsome face had rendered any spoken rebuke
for levity unnecessary.</p>

<p>After all, they had left an impression, those Morchards,
all of them, Quentillian reflected.</p>

<p>Lucilla had been calm, matter-of-fact, competent—perhaps
a little inhuman. Val, impetuous, noisy, inclined
to defiance, yet frankly terrified of her father.
Flossie—impossible to think of her as Flora, unless
the name was uttered in the Canon’s full, deep tones—surely
the prettiest of the three, gentler than Val, less
self-assured than Lucilla, timid only with her father.
Adrian, of course, did not speak the truth. His contemporaries
had known it, although Canon Morchard
had not realized the little boy’s habitual weakness.
But then he had never realized that the children were
afraid of him.</p>

<p>Why had they all been afraid of him?</p>

<p>Quentillian decided that it must have been because
of his own phenomenal rectitude, his high standard of
honour, and above all and especially, his deep, fundamental
sense of religion.</p>

<p>Canon Morchard, undoubtedly, lived “in the presence
of God.” Even the little boy Owen had known
that, and, thinking backwards, Quentillian was convinced
of it still.</p>

<p>He felt curious to see the Canon again. David
Morchard had said to him in Mesopotamia: “Go and
see him. They’ve none of them forgotten you, and
they’ll be glad of first-hand news. I’ve only been
home once in five years.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>The shrug of his shoulders had seemed to Quentillian
expressive.</p>

<p>But evidently David had judged his family correctly.
The Canon had written and invited his old pupil to
stay with him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It will not only be joy untold to receive news of our
dear lad, David, but a real pleasure to us all to welcome
you amongst us once more. I have not forgotten
my pupil of long-ago days, nor my daughters their
erstwhile playfellow. You will find all at home, including
Adrian. Dear fellow, I had hoped it was to
be the Church for him, but he has been so open, so
anxious to decide the whole important question <i>rightly</i>,
that one can only leave the decision to him in all
confidence. I would not hurry him in any way, but
his brief Army days are over, thank God, and we have
the untold pleasure of having him with us now, so
full of fun and high spirits, dear boy. You, with your
pre-war experience of Oxford, will perhaps be able
to talk things over with him and help him to a right
and wise decision.</p>

<p>“You will remember my eldest daughter, Lucilla.
She is still my right hand, mothering the younger
ones, and yet finding time for all sorts of wider interests
than those afforded by her secretarial work
for me. I think that you will agree with me that
Lucilla’s intellectual abilities, had she been less of a
home-bird, must have made their mark in the world.</p>

<p>“Valeria is still something of the madcap that perhaps
you remember. Her energy and enthusiasm keep
us all in the best of spirits, even though we are sometimes
a little startled at the new ideas sprung upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
us. Both she and Flora worked valiantly during the
terrible war years, though I could spare neither of
my darlings to leave home for very long at a time.
Valeria, however, was six months in France at a Canteen,
and I believe rendered really valuable service.
Little Flora, as I still call her, gives pleasure to us all
with her music, and our men in hospital were sharers
in her gift as far as we could manage it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Quentillian took up yet another sheet of notepaper
covered with small, legible writing. It came back to
him with a sense of familiarity, that the Canon had always
been an expansive and prolific writer of letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Make us a long visit, my dear boy. There are no
near ones to claim you, alas, and I should like you to
remember that it was to us that your dear father and
mother first confided you when they left you for what
we then hoped was to be only a short term of years.
God saw otherwise, my dear lad, and called them unto
Himself. <i>How</i> incomprehensible are His ways, and
how, through it all, one must feel that mysterious certainty
‘<i>all</i> things work together for good, to those
that love Him!’ Those words have been more present
to me than I can well tell you, during the years of
storm and stress. David’s long, weary time in Mesopotamia
tried one high, but when Adrian, my Benjamin,
buckled on his armour and went forth, my
heart <i>must</i> have failed me, but for that wonderful
strength that seems to bear one up in the day of tribulation.
How often have I not said to myself: ‘He hath
given His angels charge over thee ... in their hands
they shall bear thee up, lest haply thou dash thy foot
against a stone!’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Perhaps you will smile at this rambling letter of an
almost-old man, but I fancy that as one grows older,
the need to bear testimony becomes ever a stronger
and more personal thing. His ways <i>are</i> so wonderful!
It seems to me, for instance, a direct gift from His
hand that the Owen Quentillian to whom I gave his
first Latin prose should be returning to us once more,
a distinguished young writer. I wonder if we shall
recognize you? I have so vivid a recollection of the
white hair and eyelashes that made the village boys
call out, ‘Go it, Snowball!’ as they watched your prowess
on the football field!</p>

<p>“Well, dear fellow, I must close this. You have only
to let us know the day and hour of your arrival, and
the warmest of welcomes awaits you.</p>

<p>“I <i>must</i> sign myself, in memory of old happy times,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours ever affectionately,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Fenwick Morchard</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Quentillian, with great precision, folded the sheets
together again.</p>

<p>“So Lucilla is a home-bird, Valeria is still something
of a madcap, Flora is still ‘little Flora,’ and Adrian
is a dear lad who is anxious to decide rightly about his
future career.”</p>

<p>He wondered doubtfully whether he himself would
come to endorse the Canon’s opinion of the Canon’s
progeny.</p>

<p>And what was the Canon himself, if labels were
to be thus distributed?</p>

<p>The sensation of doubt in Quentillian’s mind was
accentuated, but he concluded his reflections by reminding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
himself, half tolerantly, and half with a certain
grimness, that the Canon was at least, according to
himself, Quentillian’s ever affectionate Fenwick Morchard.</p>


<h3>(ii)</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">This</span> is like old times,” said Quentillian.</p>

<p>Lucilla Morchard smiled, shook hands with him, and
made no answer, and Quentillian immediately, and with
annoyance, became conscious that the occasion was
not in the least like old times.</p>

<p>Apparently Miss Morchard did not accept <i>clichés</i>
uncritically.</p>

<p>Her face, indeed, expressed a spirit both critical and
perceptive. Quentillian could still trace the schoolgirl
Lucilla in the clearly-cut, unbeautiful oval, with the
jaw slightly underhung, grey, short-sighted eyes, and
straight black brows. Her dark hair was folded plainly
beneath her purple straw hat, but he could discern that
there was all the old abundance of it. Her figure was
tall and youthful, but her face made her look fully her
age. He surmised that Lucilla must be thirty-five,
now.</p>

<p>“This time, my father <i>is</i> here to welcome you.”</p>

<p>She turned round, and Quentillian saw the Canon.</p>

<p>“Ah, dear fellow! Welcome—welcome you be, indeed!”</p>

<p>A hand grasped Quentillian’s hand, an arm was laid
across his shoulders, and the Canon’s full, hearty voice,
very deep and musical, rang in his ears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Quentillian felt inadequate.</p>

<p>With all the acute self-consciousness of the modern,
he was perfectly aware that Canon Morchard’s warmth
of feeling and ardour of demonstration awoke in himself
nothing but a slight, distinctly unpleasant, sensation
of gratitude, and a feeble fear of appearing as unresponsive
as he felt.</p>

<p>“I think it’s the same Owen Quentillian, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The steady pressure of the Canon’s arm compelled
his unwilling returned prodigal to remain still, facing
him, and submit to a scrutiny from kind, narrowed
eyes.</p>

<p>“Just the same. All is well—well, indeed.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s hand smote Quentillian gently between
the shoulders, as they walked down the platform.</p>

<p>“The trap is waiting, dear boy. They are eager for
your arrival, at home. I have my whole goodly company
awaiting you, thank God—Lucilla here, and my
merry Valeria, and little Flora with her incurably shy
ways, and my Benjamin—the youngest of the flock—Adrian.
You and Adrian must have many talks, dear
lad. I want just such a friend for him as yourself—full
of youth, and fun, and merriment, as he is himself,
and yet able to help him when it comes to facing the
deeper issues—the deeper issues. You young people
must have many wise, deep talks, together, such as
youth loves. I remember my University days so well
and how ‘we tired the sun with talking’—aye, Owen,
your father and I were famous philosophers, once upon
a time! How does that strike you, eh?”</p>

<p>It struck Quentillian principally that his father’s
contemporary reminded him oddly of a book of late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Victorian memoirs, but he did not voice the impression
aloud.</p>

<p>Instead, it was a relief to him to be able to make
an obvious, and yet perfectly sincere, comment upon
the unchanged aspect of the old red-brick house, standing
well away from the small town.</p>

<p>“Valeria is our gardener,” said Canon Morchard.
“You will be consulted about various borders and the
like, no doubt. But we have all of us an interest in
botany. You must remember that from the old days,
eh? There was a collecting craze, if I remember
rightly, that led to a great deal of friendly rivalry
amongst you children.”</p>

<p>Quentillian’s recollection of the collecting craze differed
so drastically from that of the Canon, that he
glanced involuntarily at Lucilla. She met his eye
calmly, but he fancied a little latent hostility in her
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>It rather served to confirm his impression of the
extreme lack of spontaneity that had characterized
those bygone excursions into the realms of Nature.
They had been undertaken, at least by himself and his
ally and contemporary, Valeria, with one eye, as it
were, upon the Canon’s study window. Even Adrian,
if Quentillian remembered rightly, had relaxed the
normal enthusiasm of boyhood in the pursuit of bird’s
eggs, after the wondrous eye for detail of the bird’s
Creator had been sufficiently often pointed out to
him.</p>

<p>“Welcome home,” said the Canon happily. “You
remember the old garden? I seem to recollect some
capital fun going on amongst the old rhododendron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
bushes at hide-and-seek, eh? We play lawn-tennis,
nowadays. I see a sett is going on now. Who is
here this afternoon, Lucilla?”</p>

<p>“Captain Cuscaden is playing with Flora, and I suppose
it’s Mr. Clover in the far court.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. Clover is my excellent curate, who
has been one of ourselves for several years now. Sit
ye down, young people, sit ye down. Tea will be
out here directly, and the players will no doubt come for
refreshment.”</p>

<p>The Canon settled himself with the deliberation of
a heavily-built man, and leant back in his wicker chair,
with finger-tips joined together, the breeze stirring
the thick grey hair upon his temples.</p>

<p>It was a cameo-like head, with something of the
ivory colouring of a cameo, but the cameo’s blank orbs
were replaced by deeply-set, brilliant hazel eyes of
which the flashing, ardent outlook recalled at once the
child and the fanatic. Innumerable fine lines were
crossed and recrossed at the corners of either socket,
but the broad forehead was singularly open and unlined.</p>

<p>Quentillian noted the feminine sweetness of the
closed mouth, contrasting with the masculine jut of
the strong, prominent jaw. His mind registered simultaneously
the recollection of the Canon’s violent and
terrifying outbursts of anger, and his astonishing capabilities
of tenderness.</p>

<p>The latter expression was altogether predominant, as
the tennis players came to join the group under the
cedars.</p>

<p>“Valeria—Flora—you need no introductions here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
dear lad. Clover, let me present my old pupil—one
of whom you have very often heard us speak—Owen
Quentillian. This is my very good friend and helper.
And.... Ah, Captain Cuscaden—Mr. Quentillian.”</p>

<p>Quentillian fancied less enthusiasm in this last introduction,
and it seemed to him significant that no
descriptive phrase followed the name. Either Captain
Cuscaden was not worth classifying, or he could not
satisfactorily be relegated into any class, and Quentillian
suspected that Canon Morchard would resent the
latter state of affairs more than the former.</p>

<p>At all events, Cuscaden was good-looking, of bold
allure and sunburnt face, revealing the most perfect
of teeth in a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Clover was sandy and pale and seemed to be
talkative.</p>

<p>“I believe I should have known you anywhere,”
Valeria Morchard told Quentillian, frankly gazing at
him. He was not sorry to have the opportunity of gazing
back as frankly at her.</p>

<p>As children, the handsome or unhandsome looks of
Val, his inseparable playmate, had naturally interested
him not at all. He had vaguely acquiesced in the universal
nursery dictum that Flora, with her fair curls
and wide, innocent eyes, was pretty, but he now found
her blond slenderness insignificant in the extreme compared
to Valeria, with her tall and perfectly balanced
figure, ripe-apricot bloom, and brown laughing eyes.
No longer a very young girl, she somehow combined
the poise of her twenty-seven years with a shy, semi-abruptness
of diction reminiscent of seventeen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Quentillian thought her charming.</p>

<p>So, apparently, did the other men.</p>

<p>“And who bore off the palm of victory?”</p>

<p>Canon Morchard indicated the tennis court.</p>

<p>“We won, at five games all. A very good sett,”
Clover replied. “My partner’s service is almost invincible.”</p>

<p>Canon Morchard smiled.</p>

<p>“We think Valeria’s service is her strong point,” he
explained to Quentillian. “She was coached by our
dear David, and David is no mean player, I assure you.
Little Flora needs to stand up to the ball better—stand
up to the ball better. Flora has the feminine tendency
to hit out too soon—eh, Flora? Our champion is
Adrian, however. You and he will have some great
contests, I foresee.”</p>

<p>The more the Canon foresaw, the more did Quentillian’s
own aspirations turn in search of contrary
directions. The only diversion of those predicted by
his host, of which he felt able to tolerate the thought,
was that of being consulted by Valeria upon the herbaceous
borders.</p>

<p>“Clover, there, has a particularly good stroke on to
the back line, but you’ll get to know it. Have you
played at all since you left the ’Varsity?”</p>

<p>“I got a good deal of tennis when I was home on
leave in nineteen-sixteen, but nothing after that, when
I was in Mesopotamia.”</p>

<p>“Were you not in Flanders, dear boy?”</p>

<p>“In ’fifteen and ’sixteen,” said Quentillian briefly.</p>

<p>He wished to remember neither his two years on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Western front, nor his many months in Hospital with
shell-shock.</p>

<p>“Where did you and David meet, in Mesopotamia?”
inquired Lucilla.</p>

<p>Quentillian had forgotten her presence, if not her
existence, but he felt grateful to her for sparing him
the tentative category of his soldiering capabilities
which he suspected the Canon of having in readiness.</p>

<p>He was not, however, given time to answer Lucilla’s
question.</p>

<p>The Canon’s hand was uplifted.</p>

<p>“Ah, Lucilla my dear—please! My little talk with
Owen there, is to come later. There is so much that
I want to hear about our David—much, indeed. And
you shall have your share of news about your brother,
my child, but wait—at least wait—until we have had
our little private talk together.”</p>

<p>Lucilla bent her head a little under the rebuke either
in acquiescence or to conceal some slight confusion; but
Valeria blushed hotly and unmistakably, and everyone
looked constrained except the Canon, who looked rather
severe, rather grieved, and at the same time perfectly
serene. When he spoke again, it was with marked
suavity.</p>

<p>“Tell us something of your literary work, dear fellow,”
he requested Quentillian. “I am ashamed to say
that I have read nothing of yours, as yet. My time is
so little my own. Lucilla here is our literary critic.”</p>

<p>He placed his thin, beautiful hand, for a fleeting
moment upon his eldest daughter’s hand.</p>

<p>“Lucilla tells me that she knows your work. Critical
essays, is it?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Quentillian gravely acknowledged the truth of the
assertion. His self-consciousness rather enhanced
than diminished in him a keen appraisement, perhaps
rather less detached than he would have liked it to be,
of his own literary value.</p>

<p>“I published a small volume of essays before the
war, but since then I have only been a very occasional
contributor to one or two of the reviews.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. You must let me see what you have done,
some day. This is the era of youth. Indeed, some
of the things I see in print today strike me as not only
crude and immature, but absolutely mischievous—false,
foolish, shallow teaching from those who have never
submitted to be taught themselves. I am not afraid
of that in your case, Owen. But remember this, all
you young people: Nothing can be of real or lasting
value that is not founded upon the broad principles of
Christianity—charity, self-sacrifice, humility, loving-kindness.
One feels that, more than ever, nowadays,
when cynicism is so much in fashion.”</p>

<p>The Canon leant back in his chair again with his
eyes closed, as though momentarily exhausted by the
extraordinary passion with which he had spoken.</p>

<p>So profoundly did Owen Quentillian disagree with
his host, that he remained absolutely silent. He reminded
himself that since his majority he had sought,
voluntarily, only the companionship of those whose
views were at least as progressive as his own. He
had almost forgotten that those other, older, views
existed, were held with a passion of sincerity contrasting
oddly with the cool, detached, carefully impersonal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
logic that was the only attitude contemplated by himself
and his kind for the consideration of all problems
of ethics, morals, or of Life itself.</p>

<p>No doubt the Canon did not admit the normal evolution
of the art of self-sacrifice to be self-advertisement,
and held the officious pelican to be the best of
birds.</p>

<p>Quentillian, horribly aware of his own priggishness,
wanted to reform the whole of the Canon’s philosophy
at once.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he retained enough humour to hope that
the preposterous desire had not been apparent in his
silence.</p>

<p>His eyes met those of Valeria Morchard, and read
there amusement, and something not unlike protest.</p>

<p>Lucilla, in her level voice, offered him tea.</p>

<p>“The cup that cheers,” said Mr. Clover in a nervous
way.</p>

<p>The ineptitude roused in Quentillian a disproportionate
sense of irritation and renewed his old conviction
that his nerves were not even yet under his complete
control.</p>

<p>As though the Canon, too, were mildly averse from
such trivialities, he began to speak again.</p>

<p>“What one feels in the cleverness of the day is the
note of ugliness that prevails. Do you not feel that?
The sordid, the grotesque, the painful—all, all sought
out and dwelt upon. That, we are told, is the new
realism. We know, indeed, that there is a sad side to
life, but is it realism to dwell only upon one side of
the picture? Surely, surely, a sane optimism were the
better outlook—the truer realism.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“You don’t think, then, that the optimism of England
is responsible for her present plight, sir?”</p>

<p>Quentillian’s tone was one of respectful suggestion,
but he was aware that Val, beside him, had suddenly
caught her breath as though at an audacity, and that
Flora and Mr. Clover were both gazing anxiously at
the Canon.</p>

<p>A flash of lightning shot from those ardent eyes
straight into the passionless irony of the younger
man’s.</p>

<p>“But for England’s optimism, there would be no
England today. It was the spirit of optimism that won
the war, Owen.”</p>

<p>A sick recollection of men, armed and disciplined,
taking steady aim at other men, standing against a wall
to be shot for cowardice or treason, of grey-faced
commanders leading those who followed them into
certain death, all surged into Quentillian’s rebellious
mind. They, the men who had been there, had known
better than to prate of optimism.</p>

<p>They had faced facts, had anticipated disaster, had
envisaged the worst possibilities, and their pessimism
had won the war.</p>

<p>“Are you, too, bitten with the folly of the day?”</p>

<p>The Canon’s voice was gentle again, his arm once
more laid across Quentillian’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Did I not hear something about shell-shock, dear
fellow? We must have no talk of the war here.
Thank God for that He hath brought it to an end.
Tell me, dear lad, will you play tennis?”</p>

<p>Bewildered, almost affronted, Quentillian yet agreed
to play tennis, feeling himself more like a forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
boy, being treated with forbearance, than like a modern
intellect illuminating the way of thought for the older
generation.</p>

<p>He played with Valeria as his partner, and found
the Canon’s eulogy of her service to be entirely justified.</p>

<p>He found an opportunity at the end of the game
of expressing his admiration for her play, and she
replied, conventionally enough, that she had a great
deal of practice.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much else to do,” she added, with a
slight grimace.</p>

<p>Under pretext of looking for a distant ball, they
continued the conversation.</p>

<p>“If you remember this place at all,” Val said, “you
know how dull it is. Just tennis in the summer, and
horrible bazaars and jumble sales, and never a new
person or a new idea from year’s end to year’s end.”</p>

<p>“It sounds appalling. But, after all, you’re not
bound, in the old, antiquated way. You can go away.”</p>

<p>“No I can’t,” she said bluntly. “I did get to France,
for six months, during the war, but it was only <i>because</i>
it was the war. And even then—oh, well, the sort
of letters I got were enough to make me feel that
Father really hated my being there.”</p>

<p>Quentillian was genuinely aghast.</p>

<p>“But I thought that sort of attitude had gone out
with all the other Victorian traditions. I thought
women did what they liked—were as free as men.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it says in the books I read, and what
some of the girls I met in France told me. But it
isn’t like that here. And one <i>can’t</i> hurt Father. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
know what he’s like—so good, and so sensitive, and—and
so noble, somehow. He makes modern things
seem trivial—vulgar, even.”</p>

<p>“Your father is a reactionary,” said Quentillian
kindly, rather as one might say: “Your father is a
Hottentot.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think that he just wants us to stay
at home and arrange the flowers,” Val said. “You
know how he always wanted us to have intellectual
interests. Oh, Owen, don’t you remember the collections?”</p>

<p>She broke off, and blushed and laughed.</p>

<p>“It seems so very natural—I’ve so often thought of
you as Owen.”</p>

<p>“That was very nice of you, Val,” said Quentillian
calmly.</p>

<p>He had every intention of retaining his early privileges,
where Val was concerned.</p>

<p>“I should like to read some of the things you’ve
written,” she said abruptly. “Lucilla reads your articles,
and has always admired them.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Quentillian so extremely natural that
anybody who read his articles should admire them,
that he was conscious of receiving a slight shock when
Valeria added:</p>

<p>“I gather that Father wouldn’t like them at all. Lucilla
always kept them out of his way.”</p>

<p>“She is devoted to him, I can see that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>Something in her voice made him look at her, and
she exclaimed, half laughing and half petulant: “We’re
all devoted to him, Lucilla and Flossie and I! I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
mean the least shadow of a criticism of <i>him</i>. Only
that it’s a little difficult, sometimes, to keep up to his
level.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Quentillian so monstrous a state of
affairs that the Canon’s three daughters should have
no worthier aim in life than the one implied, that
something of his feeling was reflected in his face, and
Valeria on the instant applied herself to looking for
the missing ball, found it, and returned to the tea-table
and the group there.</p>

<p>The Canon was again speaking, this time to young
Cuscaden.</p>

<p>“If it is to be Canada, I believe I could give you one
or two introductions that might be of service to you.
The Government people, for instance.... I have
one or two very good friends amongst them. You
are really anxious to leave the Army and try colonization?”</p>

<p>“Quite determined to, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you young fellows, you young fellows! It
seems to me that there is none of the spirit of stability
that existed in our day! But perhaps the wish to see
further afield is a natural one. Certainly, my own
greatest regret is that I have had so little time for
travelling.”</p>

<p>He turned to Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Your dearest mother and I had planned a visit to
Italy the very year that she was taken from us. Well,
well! It was not to be. I shall never see the Eternal
City now, I imagine, except with the eyes of the mind.
Clover, you are amongst those who have seen Rome.
Think of it! Seen Rome, where Peter healed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Paul preached the Gospel, where Laurence and Agnes
and Cyprian and countless others were martyred! Tell
us something of the Coliseum.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clover did not give the effect of being an eloquent
person, but he had evidently been called upon
before by the Canon, and he gave a not unilluminating
little description, punctuated, and indeed supplemented,
by Canon Morchard’s exhaustive comments.</p>

<p>Quentillian listened in a sort of amazement, not at
all untinged by a rather uncertain wonder as to how
he should ever sustain his own part in these ingenuous
conversations....</p>

<p>The others, he saw, listened, with the possible exception
of Lucilla, whose eyes were fixed upon a distant
flower-bed.</p>

<p>Captain Cuscaden kept his gaze upon Valeria, but
he put in an occasional question, generally upon a subject
of architecture. Flora played with a leaf and said
nothing at all, and Val, unconsciously, Quentillian felt
sure, repeated everything her father said in more colloquial
English.</p>

<p>“It amazes me to realize that with a lack of all our
modern appliances, such veritable giants of architecture
should yet have been raised,” mused the Canon.</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it wonderful to think they had none of
our machines and things, and yet made those enormous
statues and gates and things?” said Val.</p>

<p>“Well for us, indeed, that they did so, my child.
Every fresh excavation proves to be a new link with
the past.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Mr. Clover.</p>

<p>“Yes, all the new things they dig up seem to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
a fresh link with those old Roman days,” echoed Val
faithfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Mr. Clover.</p>

<p>“If any of you young people followed the accounts
of the recent Egyptian excavations—Valeria, I think
you are our keenest antiquarian—were you not struck
by the extraordinary confirmation of Scripture narrative
afforded by each fresh discovery?”</p>

<p>This time Mr. Clover only said “Indeed?” and Valeria
repeated:</p>

<p>“Yes, it all carried out the things one reads in the
Bible, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“We required no such confirmation, certainly, but
it comes to one as a fresh joy, and brings these things
home with full force.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Clover, with what Quentillian perversely
chose to regard as misplaced ingenuity, once more
found a variation of his formula, and remarked, “Indeed,
yes.”</p>

<p>On these lines they talked about Egypt.</p>

<p>Then they talked about Rome again.</p>

<p>Then they went back to Egypt.</p>

<p>Quentillian looked at the rebellious profile beneath
Val’s shady hat, and came to the conclusion that,
whether she fully realized it or not, she was as profoundly
bored as himself.</p>

<p>It was Captain Cuscaden who released them from
the strain, by rising to take his leave.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you have not seen Adrian. He will be
disappointed to have missed you,” Canon Morchard
said courteously. “Another day, when Adrian is at
home, you must come over again. He is spending the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
afternoon with friends at a distance, and will hardly
be home before dinner-time. You must come over
again.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I should like to very much.”</p>

<p>Something in the Captain’s prompt reply convinced
Quentillian that his acceptance was not merely a conventional
one.</p>

<p>“Your motor-bicycle is round by the hall door,” said
Valeria, and she and Captain Cuscaden left the garden
together.</p>

<p>“And now, dear lad, you and I must have some talk
together.”</p>

<p>Rather to Quentillian’s dismay, the firm and genial
pronouncement of his host seemed to have been anticipated.
Lucilla could be discerned bending over the
distant flower-bed which had been the object of her
solicitation during the talk about Rome, and Flora had
disappeared. Mr. Clover now turned and hastened
towards the house.</p>

<p>“You and I have had our heart-to-heart talks before
now, Owen,” said the Canon affectionately. “We must
have many more of them, dear fellow—many more.”</p>


<h3>(iii)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> natural instinct of Quentillian, as of everybody
else, was to suppose that a heart-to-heart talk must
necessarily be upon the subject of himself.</p>

<p>He was therefore slightly disconcerted, though also
undoubtedly relieved, when he perceived that the
Canon’s thoughts were only preoccupied with his own
two sons.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>They disposed of David with a rapidity that was
partly due to Quentillian’s own determined uncommunicativeness,
and partly to the Canon’s evident anxiety
to get on to the topic of Adrian.</p>

<p>“I wish David had been able to come home before
returning to India, but no doubt these things are ordered
for us. He writes fondly and affectionately,
dear boy—fondly and affectionately. Not as often as
I could wish, perhaps, but the young are thoughtless.
It costs so little to send one line to those who are
anxiously waiting and watching at home! Well, well—it
has been a great joy to hear that the dear fellow
is his own bright self. And his faith, Owen? Is all
well there? Did he say anything to you of that?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>The Canon sighed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was not to be expected. You of the
present generation do not discuss these things as we
did. Even at Oxford, I am told, the men no longer
preoccupy themselves with such questions in the same
way.”</p>

<p>“Some do, sir,” said Quentillian, beginning to feel
rather sorry for the Canon.</p>

<p>The Canon, however, received Quentillian’s consolatory
effort very much at its true worth.</p>

<p>“Some do, perhaps, as you say, but they are not
those from whom any very valuable contribution to the
problems of the times is to be expected. The tone
of Oxford is not what it was, Owen—not what it was.
It lessens my disappointment at not sending Adrian
there, to find an Alma Mater indeed, as his father
before him. One had always thought of the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
for him, dear boy, but these things cannot be forced.
His soldiering seems to have put an end to any leanings
that way. Adrian is one reason, amongst many others,
why I am glad to welcome you amongst us, Owen. He
may find it easier to discuss things with a contemporary,”
said the Canon wistfully. “Your own destiny,
I imagine, is sealed?”</p>

<p>Quentillian assented, although he had thought of the
very small property recently inherited by himself in no
such grandiloquent terms.</p>

<p>“When do you take possession of your kingdom?”</p>

<p>“In a few months, sir. The place was let during my
uncle’s lifetime, and there are repairs to be done before
I go there. I intend to live there, and try my hand
at farming.”</p>

<p>He purposely omitted any mention of his writing.</p>

<p>“Good—good—excellent indeed. And we shall not
be very distant neighbours, eh?”</p>

<p>“Just the other side of the county, sir. I should
like to go over there from here, if you’re kind enough
to put up with me for two or three days.”</p>

<p>“By all means, of course—but let there be no talk
of two or three days, Owen, between you and me.
Make this your headquarters; come and go quite freely,
as one of ourselves. We have always thought of you
as one of ourselves,” said the Canon warmly. “I
think you have no very close ties, this side of the
Great Division?”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much indeed,” said Quentillian,
feeling unable to accept the Great Division even by
implication, but sincerely grateful for the Canon’s most
genuine and spontaneous kindness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“It’s more than good of you to receive me so kindly,
and I shall be only too glad to take you at your word.”</p>

<p>He wished that his self-consciousness had allowed
him to make this speech without a perfectly clear realization
that he only did so because the normal economy
of expression habitual to him would have left the elder
man dissatisfied.</p>

<p>As it was, the Canon’s arm was, for the second time
that day, affectionately laid across Quentillian’s shoulders,
and thus they paced the garden and eventually
entered the house, to the extreme relief of the Canon’s
unresponsive prop.</p>

<p>“Your room, dear Owen. Lucilla is my housekeeper.
Ask her for anything you want,” said the Canon, carrying
Quentillian back to his ninth year, and almost
making him expect to hear next that Valeria was the
Canon’s tomboy.</p>

<p>No such inapposite piece of information followed,
and Quentillian expressed his pleasure at the very
charming room in which he found himself.</p>

<p>“Make it your own, dear lad, for as long as you
will,” and, as though irrepressibly, the Canon added as
he closed the door: “Bless you.”</p>

<p>At dinner, Quentillian saw Adrian Morchard. He
thought him very like his sister Val, and also very like
the little boy who had rehearsed aloud colours for each
day of the week.</p>

<p>Adrian spoke of Quentillian’s writings, said that he
had read some of them, and was instantly and silently
disbelieved by the author. The subject was not pursued.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, later on in the evening, Flora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
played the piano, and although Quentillian was no
musician, he had sufficient knowledge to understand
that Flora was one. She played Bach, at the Canon’s
request, and Debussy at Adrian’s. The Canon admitted,
with a slight, grave smile, that he did not admire
Debussy.</p>

<p>Valeria occupied herself with needlework, but Lucilla
sat with her hands folded until her father said
gently:</p>

<p>“Are we to see none of your great tomes tonight,
my dear?”</p>

<p>Lucilla rose, and her father explained to the guest:</p>

<p>“There are certain references for a small compilation
that I may one day attempt, which Lucilla is kindly
looking out for me. You remember her as a very
scholarly little girl, no doubt.”</p>

<p>The nearest thing Quentillian could compass to this
was a very distinct remembrance of having listened to
several of the novels of Sir Walter Scott, read aloud
by Lucilla, and the Canon looked very much pleased
at the reminiscence.</p>

<p>“We are not without our literary evenings now,”
he declared. “There have been some very pleasant
readings and discussions round the lamp on winter
evenings. Lucilla provides me with some absorbing
book, and Valeria has her strip of embroidery there,
and Flora is busy with her pencil. I enjoy a pleasant
evening of reading aloud.”</p>

<p>The present occasion was not, however, one of reading
aloud; nevertheless, Quentillian had none of the
talk with Valeria that he had half-hoped to have.</p>

<p>The Canon’s attitude towards his family circle was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
patriarchal. He sat in an armchair and talked a great
deal to Quentillian, and his eyes rested with grave satisfaction
upon his children, grouped round him.</p>

<p>They remained there until half-past nine, when the
Canon read prayers to the assembled household.</p>

<p>“We break up early,” he said afterwards to Quentillian.
“Lucilla and I have work to do—she is always
my right hand. Valeria and Flora, I believe, discuss
mysterious questions of <i>chiffons</i> upstairs. Don’t prolong
the conference too late, though, my dears. I
heard voices last night as I came upstairs, which was
not as it should be—not as it should be. Owen, dear
boy, Adrian will look after you. Good-night to you
all.”</p>

<p>The Canon kissed Val and Flora each on the forehead
and laid his hand for an instant upon either head
with a murmur that was evidently an habitual nightly
blessing.</p>

<p>Then he went into his study with Lucilla, and Adrian
and Quentillian sat in the smoking-room making desultory
conversation that bore not the slightest resemblance
to the wise, deep talks of the Canon’s forecastings.</p>

<p>The forecastings of the Canon, in fact, like those
of many other dominating personalities, were scrupulously
carried out in his presence, and thankfully allowed
to lapse in his absence.</p>

<p>As of old, it was only Lucilla who was completely
at ease in her father’s company, and Quentillian presently
came to the conclusion that her silence, her unemotional
acquiescences, denoted a mind that was
merely a reflection of his.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Flora, remote, gentle, preoccupied with her music,
gave him the odd illusion of being slightly withdrawn
from them all.</p>

<p>Only in Valeria were to be discerned suppressed, but
unmistakable, flashes of rebellion, and with Valeria,
Quentillian, as usual scrutinizing his own impressions
under a microscope, presently suspected himself of falling
quietly in love.</p>

<p>In common with most young men of his day, Quentillian
considered himself to have outlived passion. In
effect, the absorbing episode of his young manhood was
in fact over, and Val, ingenuous and beautiful, was
provocative of the normal reaction.</p>

<p>One night she joined Adrian and Quentillian in the
smoking-room, after the Canon’s usual disappearance
into his study.</p>

<p>With a look half-frightened and half-mischievous,
she lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>Adrian laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so guilty, Val. It isn’t a crime, and
besides, no one will know.”</p>

<p>Val coloured in a childish way, and said to Quentillian:</p>

<p>“My father knows that I smoke—at least, I think
he knows, in a sort of way. He doesn’t like it, and
that’s why I don’t do it in front of him,” she concluded
naïvely.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, Val,” said Adrian. “You and
Flossie ought to assert yourselves more. It would
make it much easier for me, if you did. Father’s ideas
about women are so old-fashioned, one can’t introduce
him to any of one’s friends.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Quentillian exchanged a glance with Valeria. It
required small acumen to translate the plurality of
Adrian’s “friends” into the singular, and the feminine
singular at that.</p>

<p>“Father is very broad-minded,” said Valeria conscientiously.
“He never says that smoking is wrong;
only that it’s unfeminine.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t anything of the sort,” Adrian declared with
the most astonishing violence. “Some people—girls—require
it for their nerves. It soothes them. It doesn’t
make them in the least unfeminine. I met a girl the
other day—you’d have liked her awfully, Val—and she
simply smoked <i>perfectly</i> naturally, the whole time, just
like a man.”</p>

<p>“Who was she?” inquired Val smoothly.</p>

<p>“Let me see—what was her name now?”</p>

<p>This time Quentillian avoided Valeria’s eyes, positively
abashed by the extreme hollowness of Adrian’s
pretence at forgetfulness.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—Olga Duffle—Miss Olga Duffle. She is
staying with the Admastons—the people I was with
the day you arrived, Owen. Don’t you think you girls
might ask them all over to tennis, one of these days?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so—yes, of course we will. Would
Father like Miss Duffle? He doesn’t much care for
the Admastons, does he?”</p>

<p>“Absolute prejudice, my dear girl. You’ve got into
a rut, all you people down here—that’s what you’ve
done. You’d like Olga most awfully—everybody does.
She’s the most popular girl in London, and not a bit
spoilt, although she’s an only child and her people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
adore her. Mrs. Duffle told me herself that Olga was
just like a ray of sunshine at home.”</p>

<p>“What an original woman Mrs. Duffle must be,”
murmured Val.</p>

<p>“I always think there must be something remarkable
about any girl, if her own nearest relations speak well
of her,” Quentillian said in detached accents.</p>

<p>Adrian looked suspiciously at his audience.</p>

<p>“You’d like Olga awfully,” he repeated rather pathetically.
“And I can tell you this, Val, she’d give
you and Flossie no end of hints about clothes and
things. She dresses better than any girl I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>Valeria was roused to no display of enthusiasm by
this culminating claim of Miss Duffle on her regard.</p>

<p>“What sort of age is she?”</p>

<p>“She looks about eighteen, but I believe she’s
twenty-four and a bit,” said Adrian with some precision.
“She plays tennis, too, rippingly. You’d better
ask the Admastons to bring her over, I can tell you.
It isn’t everyone who gets the chance of playing with
a girl like that.”</p>

<p>“We might have a tennis party next week,” Val considered.
“I shall only ask one Admaston girl; we’ve
too many girls as it is. One Admaston, and this Olga
person, and Lucilla and I—Flossie won’t play if anybody
very good is there. That’s four, and then you
and Owen and Mr. Clover—and we could have Captain
Cuscaden. I’ll talk to Lucilla about it, if you like,
Adrian.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care about it. It’s for your own sake,
really, that I suggested it,” Adrian explained.</p>

<p>His forefinger carefully traced out the pattern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
stamped upon the leather arm of his chair, and he
contemplated it earnestly with his head upon one side,
even murmuring a sub-audible—“One—two—three—and
a corner”—before clearing his throat.</p>

<p>“H’m. No, my dear Val, don’t run away with the
idea that I’m wildly keen on this tennis stunt for my
own amusement. In fact, I may say I’ve been a bit
off tennis lately, simply from seeing how extraordinarily
good some amateurs can be. It discourages one,
in a way. But I thought you girls might like to know
Olga, I must say. She’d be an awfully nice friend
for you to have, you know.”</p>

<p>There was a pleading note discernible in the tone of
Adrian’s philanthropic suggestions that might have
been partly accountable for the tolerance with which
his sister received them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she said to Quentillian next day, with
a certain hint of apology:</p>

<p>“We’ve spoilt Adrian, I’m afraid. You remember
what a dear little boy he was?”</p>

<p>Quentillian remembered better still what a tiresome
little boy Adrian had been, but this recollection, as so
many others connected with the house of Morchard,
he did not insist upon.</p>

<p>“I suppose he must have his Olga if he wants to,
but I hope she’s a nice girl. You know how very
particular Father is, and I think he’s especially sensitive
where Adrian is concerned.”</p>

<p>“It struck me that perhaps he was almost inclined
to take Adrian’s affairs too seriously,” Quentillian suggested,
with great moderation. “Adrian, after all, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
very young, isn’t he, both in years and in character,
in spite of his soldiering?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he is. He’s very susceptible, too. I
sometimes think that Father doesn’t altogether make
allowance for that.”</p>

<p>Even the very negative criticism implied was so contrary
to the spirit of the house that it gave Quentillian
the agreeable illusion of partnering Valeria in a mild
domestic conspiracy, and pleased him inordinately.</p>

<p>The sense of conspiracy was deepened on the day of
the tennis party, when a Miss Admaston, gawky and
unimpressive, duly escorted Miss Olga Duffle to St.
Gwenllian.</p>

<p>She was less pretty, and possessed of more personality,
than Quentillian had expected. Very small and
slight, her face was of the squirrel type, her eyes very
large and dark, her black <i>crêpe</i> hair brushed childishly
away from her little round forehead, her nose unmistakably
<i>retroussé</i>. Two very white front teeth were
just visible, resting upon an habitually indrawn under-lip.</p>

<p>Quentillian, quite irrationally, immediately felt certain
that she spoke with a lisp. She did not, but she
certainly pronounced the name of Captain George Cuscaden,
with whom she appeared to be upon intimate
terms, as though it were spelt “Dzorze.”</p>

<p>She also called Adrian by his first name, but gave
no other startling signs of modernity. Indeed, a very
pretty, and most unmodern, deference marked her
manner towards Canon Morchard.</p>

<p>“Father likes her,” Valeria murmured to Quentillian,
who was more concerned with her charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
air of imparting to him a secret than with Miss Duffle’s
conquest of the Canon.</p>

<p>It was only at tea-time that the Canon joined the
tennis party. Immediately afterwards he made courteous
apologies and returned to the house.</p>

<p>It was undeniable that the absence of the Canon
caused the conversation, which had circled uneasily
round cathedral subjects, to lapse into triviality. The
super-critical Quentillian could not decide which form
of social intercourse he found least to his taste.</p>

<p>“Jam?” said Adrian.</p>

<p>The Canon had said, a few minutes earlier:</p>

<p>“You must try some of our strawberry jam, Miss
Duffle. My daughter Flora is responsible for it, I
believe. Lucilla there is our housekeeper, but I am
given to understand that her younger sisters are allowed
to try experiments. I will not quote: <i>Fiat
experimentum.</i>”</p>

<p>“Jam?” repeated Adrian.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a wasp in the jam! Oh, save me!”</p>

<p>Olga laughed as she uttered little cries of alarm, and
her laughter really suggested the adjective “merry.”</p>

<p>“Save the women and children!”</p>

<p>There was much ineffectual slapping of teaspoons
against the air, the tablecloth, the jam pot, and many
exclamations.</p>

<p>“Yonder he goes! Passed to you for necessary action,
Miss Admaston!”</p>

<p>“Be a man, Cuscaden; he’s right under your nose.”</p>

<p>“Dzorze, do be careful—you’ll get stung!” Olga
cried across the table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Captain Cuscaden neatly captured the wasp beneath
an empty plate.</p>

<p>“That’s got him. He’ll never lift up his head again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then may I have my jam?”</p>

<p>Olga, with her head on one side, might have been
imitating a little girl, but Quentillian could not decide
whether or no the imitation was an unconscious one.</p>

<p>“The wasp has eaten all the jam,” Adrian rejoined
in the same tone as Olga’s.</p>

<p>“Oh! he hasn’t eaten all of it.”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t eaten it all.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the wasp didn’t eat all the jam, did he?”</p>

<p>“Not quite all.”</p>

<p>“There are still a few spoonfuls left that the wasp
didn’t eat, Miss Duffle.”</p>

<p>Neither Olga, Adrian, Captain Cuscaden, Flora nor
Miss Admaston appeared to regard themselves as being
amongst the extremest examples of brainless fatuity
produced by a fatuous century. Yet thus it was that
Owen Quentillian was regarding them, whilst at the
same time another section of his brain passionlessly
registered the conviction that his nerves were still on
edge and his tendency to irrational irritability passing
almost beyond his own control.</p>

<p>After tea he remained idly in a long chair beside
Valeria, while they watched Olga’s little nimble figure
on the tennis court, where Adrian was her partner.
Lucilla played against them with George Cuscaden, and
Olga several times called out gaily: “Dzorze, I hate
you!”</p>

<p>When Lucilla sent an unplayable stroke across the
net, she only cried: “Oh, well played!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“I don’t like her voice, do you?” Val murmured
confidentially.</p>

<p>“Hideous,” said Quentillian, briefly and candidly.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Adrian thinks he’s in earnest. Of
course, I don’t suppose she’d look at him. And of
course he couldn’t think of marrying anybody for ages.
He’s too young, and he’d have to get a job.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have to do that anyway, won’t he? He says
he doesn’t dislike the idea of business, and I could give
him an introduction to a man who might be useful.”</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you. I know Father wants to get
him settled. Dear Father, he was so disappointed that
Adrian isn’t going into the Church after all, and he’s
taken it so beautifully.”</p>

<p>Quentillian regarded the Canon’s disappointment
with so much more astonishment than sympathy that
he wished only to avoid a discussion on the beauty of
its manifestation.</p>

<p>“Curiously enough, I have a living in my gift, belonging
to my very small property at Stear. The old
man there wishes to retire, and I want to consult your
father as to a new appointment. No one could be less
fitted than myself,” said Quentillian with an emphasis
not altogether devoid of satisfaction, “to nominate a
candidate for that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Val looked at him with all her peculiar directness
of gaze.</p>

<p>“Sometimes you talk as though you rather despised
the Church,” she said bluntly.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“If I have given you such an impression, I must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
apologize. It was most discourteous of me,” said
Quentillian stiffly.</p>

<p>He was fully prepared to acknowledge and to defend
his own purely rationalistic views, but the implication
of a lack of taste in his behaviour as guest in an orthodox
household offended him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that,” said Val, calmly and gravely.
“I know that a great many very clever people are not
believers in the sense that my father is one, for instance;
but they do respect the Christian ideal, all the
same. I only wondered whether you were one of them.
Do you mind my talking like this?”</p>

<p>The relentless voice of Quentillian’s inner monitor
assured him that he was, on the contrary, ready to
welcome any intimate discussion of himself and his
views, on whatever subject.</p>

<p>Val looked at him expectantly.</p>

<p>“Where I differ from, for instance, your father, is
in separating Christian morality from what might be
called the miraculous element of Christianity. Frankly,
I can’t accept the latter.”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe in the divinity of Christ?”</p>

<p>Her voice was a very much shocked one, and Quentillian
replied only by a gesture. Val kept silence, and
presently he glanced at her face and saw that tears
stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>He was half touched and half impatient.</p>

<p>“Surely that point of view isn’t altogether a new
one to you. You must know that the trend of modern
thought is all very much in that direction.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I knew it, certainly. But it has never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
come very near me before. Father has sheltered us
from everything, in the most beautiful way.”</p>

<p>She spoke very simply and sincerely.</p>

<p>The time-honoured <i>cliché</i> as to never wishing to deprive
anyone of his or her faith—Valeria least of all—hung
unspoken on his lips.</p>

<p>If the spiritual intimacy of which Owen Quentillian
was beginning to dream should come to pass between
them, he was quite clearly and definitely convinced that
Valeria’s early beliefs must go.</p>

<p>“Have you really never felt any doubt at all—any
inclination to question?”</p>

<p>Valeria looked troubled.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ve never thought it out very clearly.
One doesn’t, you know, brought up as we were.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were full of thought.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Quentillian gently, after a silence.</p>

<p>“I was hoping,” said Val, with innocent eyes turned
full upon him, “that Father would never know about
you. It would make him so unhappy.”</p>


<h3>(iv)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Val</span>, in accordance with time-honoured tradition,
nightly brushed out her long brown hair in her sister
Flora’s bedroom.</p>

<p>They talked desultorily.</p>

<p>“Choir practice tomorrow. I wish we could have
Plain Chant instead of those things....”</p>

<p>“Father doesn’t care for Plain Chant.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Give me a piece of ribbon, Flossie. I’ve lost all
mine.”</p>

<p>“Val—here, will blue do?—Val, do you think Owen
is falling in love with you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Well, to be honest, I think he is.”</p>

<p>“So do I.”</p>

<p>“That’s Lucilla going up to bed. How early they
are tonight.”</p>

<p>They heard the Canon’s voice upon the stairs outside.</p>

<p>“Good-night to you, my dear daughter. May God
have you in His keeping!”</p>

<p>Then came a gentle tap upon the bedroom door.</p>

<p>“Not <i>too</i> prolonged a conference, little girls! I
have sent Lucilla to seek her bed.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, father,” they chorused.</p>

<p>“Good-night to you, my dear children. Good-night,
and may God bless you.”</p>

<p>“Father would be pleased.”</p>

<p>Flora reverted, unmistakably, to the topic of Owen
Quentillian.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Val doubtfully.</p>

<p>“But you know he would! He is delighted with
Owen, and it would be so close to us—only an hour’s
journey. I think it would be very nice, Val,” said
Flora wistfully, “and it’s time one of us got married.
Lucilla won’t, now, and nobody ever asks me, so it had
better be you.”</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>“Nobody has ever asked <i>me</i>, except that curate we
had before Mr. Clover, and I always thought he was
more or less weak-minded,” Valeria remarked candidly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“They may not have asked you, but they’ve wanted
to,” said Flora shrewdly. “Don’t answer if you’d
rather not, but didn’t Captain Cuscaden ever...?”</p>

<p>Val crimsoned suddenly.</p>

<p>“No. That was all nonsense. I believe he’s in love
with that Olga girl.”</p>

<p>“After you? Oh, Val!”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it was ever me at all,” said Val
with averted head. “I can’t think why we’ve ever
imagined such nonsense. Anyway, it’s all over now,
and I—I think I rather hate him, now.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Flora’s tone was both highly dissatisfied and
rather incredulous.</p>

<p>“One can’t hate a person and—and like them, at
one and the same time,” Valeria exclaimed, with all
the vehemence of those who affirm that of which they
are not convinced.</p>

<p>“I suppose not. See if you can untie me, Val—I’ve
got into a knot.”</p>

<p>There was silence, and then Valeria, without looking
at her sister, suddenly said:</p>

<p>“Sometimes I wish we’d been brought up more like
other people, Flossie. I know Father’s care for us has
been beautiful—dear Father!—but somehow the girls
I was with in France seemed more alive, in a way.
They knew about things....”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that rather like Eve wanting the knowledge
of good and evil? Father always says that one should
only seek the beautiful side—‘whatsoever things are
pure, whatsoever things are holy,’ like St. Paul says.”</p>

<p>“Owen wouldn’t agree to that. He believes that one
ought to know everything, good and bad alike.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“Perhaps it’s different for a man.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. We don’t know much about men, after
all, do we, Flossie?”</p>

<p>Flossie raised her eyebrows with an indescribable
effect of fastidious distaste, and closed her lips.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I want to, particularly. Father is the
most wonderful man that anyone could ever want to
know, I should imagine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Valeria.</p>

<p>She was perfectly conscious of speaking anything
but whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>She did indeed think her father wonderful, but she
could not, like Flora, feel herself to be forever satisfied
by the contemplation of parental wonderfulness.</p>

<p>“You’re different since you came back from France,
Val. I think you’d better marry Owen,” said Flora
calmly.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t asked me, yet.”</p>

<p>There was a sound from the floor below.</p>

<p>“That was Father! He hates us to sit up late. I’d
better go before he comes up again. Good-night,
Flossie.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>Flora looked at her sister, and once more murmured:
“Father would like it, you know,” half pleadingly and
half as though in rebuke.</p>

<p>“Father doesn’t know everything about Owen. He
has been very much affected by the tone of the day,
as Father calls it. His faith....”</p>

<p>“Oh, Val! Isn’t that one reason the more? You
might do so much to help him.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Flora spoke with humourless and absolute earnestness.</p>

<p>“Valeria!”</p>

<p>The Canon’s voice, subdued but distinct, came to
them from without.</p>

<p>“My dear, go to your room. This is not right. You
are acting in defiance of my known wishes, although,
no doubt, thoughtlessly. Bid your sister good-night
and go.”</p>

<p>Val did not even wait to carry out the first half of
the Canon’s injunction. She caught up her brush and
comb and left the room.</p>

<p>“Are my wishes so little to you, Valeria?” said her
father, standing on the stairs. “It costs so small an
act of self-sacrifice to be faithful in that which is
least!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Father. We both forgot the time.”</p>

<p>“Thoughtless Valeria! Are you always to be my
madcap daughter?”</p>

<p>His tone was very fond, and he kissed her and
blessed her once more.</p>

<p>Valeria went to her own room.</p>

<p>She sat upon the side of her bed and cried a little.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be vaguely disappointing and
unsatisfactory. What if Owen Quentillian was in love
with her? He was very clever, and Val was tired of
cleverness. Father was clever—even Flora, in her
austere, musical way, was clever. Val supposed grimly
that she herself must be clever, if imposed intellectual
interests, a wide range of reading, a habit of abstract
discussion, could make her so. Nevertheless she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
guiltily conscious of desires within herself other than
purely academic ones.</p>

<p>Flora was right. Those six months in France had
made her different.</p>

<p>She had worked in a canteen, where the preoccupation
of everyone had been the procuring and dispensing
of primitive things—food, and drink, and warmth.
Women had worked with their hands for men who
had been fighting, and were going to fight again.</p>

<p>Valeria had been the quickest worker there, one of
the most efficient. The manual work, the close contact
with material things, had satisfied some craving within
herself of which she had not before been actively conscious.</p>

<p>She had learnt to cook and had become proficient
with astonishing ease. Scrambled eggs interested her
more than herbaceous borders, more than choir practises,
more, to her own surprise and shame, than evening
readings-aloud at home.</p>

<p>The canteen jokes, elementary, beer-and-tobacco-flavoured,
had amused her whole-heartedly. She had
laughed, foolishly and mirthfully, for sheer enjoyment,
knowing all the time that, judged by the criterion of
St. Gwenllian, the jests were pointless, the wit undeserving
of the name.</p>

<p>Very soon she had ceased to dwell upon any remembrance
of the criterion of St. Gwenllian. She had let
herself go.</p>

<p>There had been brief, giggling intimacies with girls
and young women whom Valeria could certainly not
visualize as intimates in her own home, allusions and
catchwords shared with the men or the orderlies, childish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
undignified escapades which she was aware that
the Canon would have regarded and apostrophised as
vulgar. Those days now seemed like a dream.</p>

<p>Even the girl with whom she had shared a room
for six months no longer wrote to her.</p>

<p>She, the bobbed-haired, twenty-two-year-old Pollie
Gordon, had had love-affairs. Valeria remembered
certain confidences made by Pollie, and still blushed.
Pollie had been strangely outspoken, to Miss Morchard’s
way of thinking, but she had been interesting—revealing
even.</p>

<p>Valeria ruefully realized perfectly that Pollie Gordon,
whether one’s taste approved of her or not, had
lived every moment of her short life to the full. She
was acutely aware of contrast.</p>

<p>“And I’m twenty-seven!” thought Val. “I’d better
go and be a cook somewhere. If only I could! Or
marry Owen—supposing he asks me. Anyway, one
might have children.”</p>

<p>A humourous wonder crossed her mind as to her
ability to cope with the intelligent, eclectically-minded
children that Owen Quentillian might be expected to
father.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity he isn’t poor. I believe I should be better
as a poor man’s wife, having to do everything for him,
and for the babies, if there were babies.... The
Colonies, for instance....”</p>

<p>Although she was alone, Val coloured again and
tears stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>“What a fool I am!”</p>

<p>It was this painfully sincere conviction that sent her
to seek the oblivion of sleep, rather than any recollection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of the fidelity in that which is least, enjoined upon
her by her father.</p>

<p>For the next few days Valeria was zealous in gardening
and tennis playing. She also, on two occasions,
fetched volumes of Lamartine and asked her father to
read aloud after dinner.</p>

<p>Her physical exertions sent her to bed tired out, and
made her sleep soundly.</p>

<p>It surprised her very much when Lucilla, who never
made personal remarks, said to her:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go away for a time, Val? You
don’t look well.”</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly all right. I only wish I had rather
more to do, sometimes.”</p>

<p>Valeria looked at her elder sister. She was less intimate
with her than with Flora. No one, in fact, was
intimate with Lucilla. She spoke seldom, and almost
always impersonally. At least, one knew that she
was discreet....</p>

<p>Val, on impulse, spoke.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose—don’t be horrified, Lucilla—do
you suppose Father would ever think of letting me go
away and work?”</p>

<p>Lucilla gave no sign of being horrified.</p>

<p>She appeared to weigh her answer before she replied.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would occur to him, of his own
accord.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. But if one asked him? Would it make
him dreadfully unhappy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lucilla matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>Valeria, disappointed and rather angry, shrugged
her shoulders.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Then, of course, that puts an end to the whole
thing.”</p>

<p>Lucilla finished stamping a small pile of the Canon’s
letters, laid them on the table, and placed a paper-weight
upon the heap before turning round to face her
sister.</p>

<p>“But why, Val?”</p>

<p>“Why what?”</p>

<p>“Why need it put an end to the whole thing? You
know as well as I do that it would make Father unhappy
for any one of us to suggest leaving home. But
if you really mean to do it, you must make up your
mind to his being unhappy about it.”</p>

<p>“Lucilla!”</p>

<p>Lucilla did not elaborate her astounding theses, but
her gaze, sustained and level, met Valeria’s astonished
eyes calmly.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose I’m as hideously selfish as that,
do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are. But you’ve a right to
your own life.”</p>

<p>“Not at anyone else’s expense.”</p>

<p>Lucilla began to stamp postcards.</p>

<p>“Lucilla, you didn’t mean that, did you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I did, Val.”</p>

<p>“That I should hurt <i>Father</i>, and go away just to
satisfy my own restlessness, knowing that he disapproved
and was unhappy? I should never know a
moment’s peace again.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you feel like that, I suppose you won’t
do it.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you feel like that, in my place?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“No, I shouldn’t; but that’s neither here nor there.
It’s for you to decide whether a practical consideration
or a sentimental one weighs most in your own particular
case.”</p>

<p>“Sentimental?”</p>

<p>Val’s indignant tone gave the word its least agreeable
meaning.</p>

<p>“It is a question of sentiment, isn’t it? Father likes
to have you at home, but he’s not dependent upon you
in any way.”</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t he say that my place was at home—that
it was only restlessness and love of independence...?”
Valeria stammered.</p>

<p>She suddenly felt very young beneath the remote,
passionless gaze of her sister. For the first time in
her life she saw Lucilla as a human being and not as
an elder sister, and she was struck with Lucilla’s
strange effect of spiritual aloofness. It would be very
easy to speak freely to anyone so impersonal as Lucilla.</p>

<p>“It’s ever since I got back from France,” said Val
suddenly. “I don’t know what’s the matter with me,
exactly, but I’ve ... wanted things. I’ve wanted
to work quite hard, at things like cooking, or sweeping—and
I’ve been sick of books, and music, and
botany. I don’t feel any of it is one scrap worth while.
And, oh, Lucilla, it’s such nonsense, because no one
wants me to cook or sweep, so I’m just ‘seeking vocations
to which I am not called,’ as Father always says.
Perhaps it’s just that I want change.”</p>

<p>Lucilla was silent.</p>

<p>“Do say what you think,” Val besought her with
some impatience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“I will if you like, but it isn’t really what I think,
or what Father thinks, that matters. It’s what you
think yourself.”</p>

<p>Valeria stamped her foot.</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>know</i> what I think.”</p>

<p>“Better go away,” Lucilla then said briefly.</p>

<p>“Work?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if that’s what you feel like. Of course, marriage
would be better.”</p>

<p>“Lucilla.”</p>

<p>“You asked me to say what I thought,” her sister
pointed out.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean Owen Quentillian,” Val said
at last. “But even if I did that—and he hasn’t asked
me to, so far—it would only mean just the same sort
of thing, only in another house. There’d be servants
to do the real work, and a gardener to do the garden,
and a nurse for the babies, if there were babies. Owen
talks about farming Stear, but he’d do it all out of
books, I feel certain. We should be frightfully—frightfully
civilized.”</p>

<p>“Owen <i>is</i> frightfully civilized.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think I am,” said Val contentiously.</p>

<p>“Lucilla, do you like Owen?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m very sorry for him, too.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Valeria could not believe that Owen would
be in the least grateful for Lucilla’s sorrow. It might
even be difficult to induce him to believe that anyone
could be sufficiently officious to indulge in such an
emotion on his behalf.</p>

<p>“I think his shell-shock has affected him much more
than he realizes,” Lucilla said. “I think his nerves are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
on edge, very often. He’d be a difficult person to live
with, Val.”</p>

<p>Valeria remained thoughtful.</p>

<p>She knew that Lucilla’s judgments, if rarely put into
words, were extraordinarily clear-cut and definite, and
as such they carried conviction to her own intuitive,
emotional impulses of like and dislike.</p>

<p>“Father likes Owen so much. Wouldn’t he be
pleased if one ever did?” Val said elliptically.</p>

<p>“Very pleased, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Of course, that isn’t really a reason for doing it.”</p>

<p>Lucilla apparently found the wisdom of her sister’s
observation too obvious for reply.</p>

<p>“Not the only reason, anyway.”</p>

<p>Lucilla’s silence was again an assent.</p>

<p>“Gossiping in the morning, my daughters?”</p>

<p>The Canon’s deep, pleasant voice preceded him as
he paused outside the open window.</p>

<p>“Is that as it should be? Lucilla, my dear love, at
your desk again? You look pale—you should be in
the open air. Is not the day a glorious one? When
this world about us is so unutterably fair, does it not
make one think of ‘eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive,
what things He hath prepared for them that
love him’?”</p>

<p>The Canon’s uplifted gaze was as joyful as it was
earnest.</p>

<p>“Heaven seems very near, on such a day,” he said
softly.</p>

<p>Val, always outspoken, and struggling with the unease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
of her own discontent, joined him at the window
and said wistfully:</p>

<p>“I can’t feel it like you do, Father. I wish I could.”</p>

<p>“Little Valeria! It will come, my dear; it will all
come. These things become more real and vivid to us
as life goes on. So many of those I love have gone
to swell the ranks of the Church Triumphant, now—such
a goodly company of friends! How can I feel it
to be a strange or far-away country, when your mother
awaits me there, and my own dear father and mother,
and such a host of friends? What a meeting that will
be, with no shadow of parting any more!”</p>

<p>Valeria was conscious of foolish, utterly unexplained
tears, rising to her throat at the tender, trustful voice
in which her father spoke.</p>

<p>How she loved him! Never could she do anything
that would hurt or disappoint him. The resolution,
impulsive and emotional, gave her a certain sense of
stability, welcome after all her chaotic self-questionings
and contradictory determinations.</p>

<p>“Will you give Owen and myself the pleasure of
your company this afternoon, Valeria? We meditate
an expedition to Stear—an expedition to Stear.”</p>

<p>She said that she would go with them.</p>

<p>None of the Canon’s children had ever refused an
invitation to go out with the Canon since the days
when the Sunday afternoons of their childhood had
been marked by the recurrent honour of a walk with
Father. An honour and a pleasure, even if rather a
breathless one, and one that moreover was occasionally
liable to end in shattering disaster, as when Flora had
been sent home in disgrace by herself for the misguided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
sense of humour that had led her, aged five,
to put out her tongue at the curate. Or that other
unforgettable episode when Val herself, teased by the
boys, had vigorously boxed Adrian’s ears.</p>

<p>She smiled as she recollected it, and wondered if
Owen remembered too, and yet there was a sort of
disloyalty in recalling the affair too closely.</p>

<p>The Canon had been so <i>very</i> angry! His anger, as
intense as it was memorable, had been succeeded by
such a prolonged period of the blackest depression!</p>

<p>Val realized thankfully that it was a long time since
any of them had seen the Canon angry.</p>

<p>She turned aimlessly down the garden.</p>

<p>The Canon had already gone indoors. He was never
other than occupied, and Valeria had never seen him
impatient of an interruption.</p>

<p>“The man who wants me is the man I want,” the
Canon sometimes quoted, with his wonderfully attractive
smile.</p>

<p>“Father <i>is</i> wonderful. <i>Never</i> could I disappoint or
grieve him,” thought Val vehemently.</p>

<p>She suddenly wheeled round and returned to the
open window, determined that Lucilla, the astonishing
Lucilla, should know of her resolution.</p>

<p>“You know what we were talking about just now?”
she demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>Lucilla looked up.</p>

<p>“I’ve quite made up my mind that your advice was
wrong,” said Val firmly. “I know you said what you
thought was best, and it’s nice of you to want me to
be independent, but, after all, one’s duty comes first.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
I don’t believe it’s my duty to dash away from home
and make Father unhappy.”</p>

<p>Lucilla looked down again.</p>

<p>“Of course, if anything happened <i>of itself</i> to make
me leave home, it would be quite different. If I married,
or anything like that. But just to go away for
a purely selfish whim——”</p>

<p>She paused expressively.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do it, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well—” Lucilla’s tone conceded, apparently, that
Val had every right to judge for herself. Further than
that, it did not go.</p>

<p>“Lucilla, if you really think like that, about living
one’s own life, and I suppose from the aggravating
way in which you won’t say anything, that you do—why
don’t you do it yourself?”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t any wish to,” said Lucilla, looking
surprised.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever had any wish to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, once. But not now.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you?” Val pursued desperately.
She felt as though she was coming really to know
her sister for the first time.</p>

<p>“I suppose because I thought, like you, that it
wouldn’t do to leave Father.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t think that any more?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did anyone advise you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. There wasn’t anything to advise about.
One has to think things out for oneself, after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Val was conscious of her own perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
craving for approval from everyone, for any course
that she might adopt.</p>

<p>“Did you ever ask anyone’s advice, Lucilla?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. If I did, it would be because I
meant to take it, and I can’t imagine wanting to let
anyone else decide things for me. Just talking about
one’s own affairs isn’t taking advice, though people
like to call it so.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a very good thing you’re not married,”
said Val crossly. “You’re too superior.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s why no one has ever asked me,”
said Miss Morchard with calm.</p>

<p>Valeria, in spite of her momentary elevation of
spirits in resolving never to grieve her father, prepared
for the visit to Stear in a discontented frame of mind.</p>

<p>At the last moment Adrian suddenly announced a
wish to accompany them.</p>

<p>“My dear! But of course—” The Canon’s pleasure
was very evident. “Owen, you will welcome this
lad of mine as part of our little excursion, eh? Why
not make one of the old-time family parties? Why
not let us all go and explore this future home of
Owen’s? It’s not very often that I have a free afternoon
nowadays—and to have all my dear ones to make
holiday with me would be indeed a rare joy.”</p>

<p>He looked round him expectantly.</p>

<p>“The caretaker won’t be able to manage tea for so
many,” said Lucilla, looking at Quentillian.</p>

<p>“There speaks my practical housekeeper!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">For though on pleasure she was bent,</div>
<div class="verse">She had a frugal mind.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Eh, Lucilla? Could you not contrive a basket for
us, my dear, picnic fashion? Come, come, let’s have
an impromptu picnic. What say you, young people?”</p>

<p>They said what the Canon wanted them to say. No
one, Val felt, could have done otherwise, in the face
of his eagerness. She was partly disappointed, and
partly relieved. There had been a certain romance in
going with Owen to see Owen’s home, with the barely
acknowledged wonder whether it might not one day
also be hers.</p>

<p>But there was no hint of romance in the solidly
packed basket presently produced by Lucilla, and reluctantly
carried by Adrian, nor in Flora’s tardiness
that nearly caused them to miss the train, nor in her
Father’s gentle, humourously worded rebuke to her.</p>


<h3>(v)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Valeria was slightly discomposed by the tribal
nature of the expedition to Stear, Quentillian was seriously
annoyed by it. He had figured to himself a
grave and gentle readjustment of values, when he
should see the place that he had known since boyhood
transformed into a setting for the figure of Valeria.</p>

<p>He did not suppose himself to be tempestuously in
love, but he had made up his mind that he greatly
wished to marry Valeria.</p>

<p>A wistful uncertainty possessed him as to whether
Valeria would wish to marry him.</p>

<p>Stear looked forlorn and uninhabited, and the repairs
were even less advanced than Quentillian had
expected them to be.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>He reflected that he ought to be upon the spot, and
shuddered involuntarily, and to his disgust, at the
lonely prospect.</p>

<p>Since his shell-shock, he had very often been afraid
of his own company, and the knowledge was peculiarly
galling to him.</p>

<p>“Your lines have fallen to you in pleasant places,
Owen,” said the Canon genially.</p>

<p>“You are optimistic, sir,” said Quentillian rather
dryly. “It will be months before these men are out
of the place.”</p>

<p>“You should move in yourself,” Lucilla suggested.</p>

<p>“I believe I should.”</p>

<p>“Thoughtless Lucilla! Why should Owen leave his
present quarters, if he is happy with us, as I trust he
is? Aye, dear Owen, you are very welcome at St.
Gwenllian whilst your own nest is being prepared
for you.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s ready hand sought Quentillian’s arm.</p>

<p>Owen glanced at Lucilla half apologetically, but her
gaze, impervious to subtleties, and mildly cheerful, met
his very readily.</p>

<p>“Please stay on with us, if you should care to.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Quentillian non-committally.</p>

<p>Later, at the Canon’s suggestion, he took them to
visit the church.</p>

<p>“You will one day have the responsibility of finding
a new shepherd for the flock here, I understand,
Owen.”</p>

<p>“I shall hope for some advice from you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aye, indeed? It’s a very good living, is it not?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Though that is very far from being the first consideration—very
far, indeed.”</p>

<p>“What’s it worth?” Adrian inquired.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s considered worth about £700 a year.”</p>

<p>“A job for a married man,” said Adrian casually.</p>

<p>An involuntary flash of amused comprehension
passed between Quentillian and Valeria. He understood
it to be in reference to this when she said to
him in a low voice on leaving the church:</p>

<p>“I don’t think Olga Duffle would make a clergyman’s
wife, do you?”</p>

<p>“I should doubt it.”</p>

<p>“But Adrian couldn’t really be thinking of it.”</p>

<p>“I thought he’d decided against the Church.”</p>

<p>“So he has. I think it was one of the greatest disappointments
Father has ever had.”</p>

<p>“Your father would only have wished it if Adrian
had wished it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Val emphatically. “Naturally, he
looks upon it as a question of vocation. Father is the
last person to ignore that.”</p>

<p>She hesitated, and then said: “Owen, do you believe
that everyone has a vocation?”</p>

<p>The question, to him so oddly reminiscent of the
perplexities of a bygone age, nearly made him laugh,
but his amusement was wholly tender.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in a special vocation straight from
Heaven for each one of us,” he admitted. “You know,
I never can believe that Heaven takes that acute personal
interest in individuals that religious people always
emphasize when they’re talking about themselves. But,
of course, there are certain lines of development——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“I think,” Val said seriously, “that I should like to
feel I had a definite job in life, that no one but myself
could do. I feel so—indefinite.”</p>

<p>“I believe I might enlighten you on that subject,”
Owen replied in measured accents.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean Sales of Work or a botanical collection,
Owen.”</p>

<p>“I know you don’t. The sales of work and the
collections were never a means of self-expression, were
they?”</p>

<p>“They did stand for something, though.”</p>

<p>“For your wish to please somebody else?”</p>

<p>“The wish is still there, Owen.”</p>

<p>“Val, you know I think self-abnegation is all wrong.”</p>

<p>He was half laughing, but the flushed face that she
turned towards him was altogether earnest.</p>

<p>“Don’t think me arrogant, Val, but I do so wish I
could make you see it as I do. Don’t you see that the
Christian ideal of self-sacrifice was only the swing
of the pendulum, from the brutal old days when men
rejoiced in seeing their fellow-creatures tortured and
killed? Feelings had to be developed, and so the
Sermon on the Mount was preached. The pendulum
has swung too far the other way now—charity has
come to mean self-advertisement or sentimentality.”</p>

<p>Quentillian, deeply interested in his own exposition
of views that were by no means new to him, was
brought up short by a call from behind him.</p>

<p>“Hi, Owen! Are you walking for a wager? I want
to ask you something.”</p>

<p>Quentillian, not at all disposed to welcome Adrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and his interrogations, was obliged to slacken his steps
as Valeria did hers.</p>

<p>Adrian was swishing at the long grasses on either
side of the road with a slender length of ash.</p>

<p>“Look here, old man, have you got anybody in your
eye for that living?”</p>

<p>Adrian’s head was studiously turned towards his
depredations with the ash-stick.</p>

<p>“Because if you haven’t—not that it matters to me,
particularly, you understand, but I’ve got a friend,
who might be the man you want.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“I should have to sound him first,” Adrian explained.
“I suppose you’d want a youngish fellow and—and
I suppose you’d rather he was married?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least.”</p>

<p>Adrian looked disturbed.</p>

<p>“I thought a parson’s wife was useful in a large,
straggling sort of place like this. Not that it matters
to me.”</p>

<p>“Is your friend married, Adrian?” Val enquired.</p>

<p>Quentillian could not decide whether the simplicity
of her manner was ironical or no.</p>

<p>“He isn’t married at present. I think he’s engaged.
You see, a living like this would justify a man in getting
married, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It would depend on the sort of person he wished
to marry.”</p>

<p>“Supposing she had a little money of her own?”</p>

<p>“The sort of girls who marry clergymen never do
have money of their own,” said Quentillian, firmly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>On this discouraging pronouncement, they were rejoined
by the rest of the party.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Valeria contrived to enquire of Quentillian,
in a disturbed murmur:</p>

<p>“What <i>can</i> Adrian be thinking of?”</p>

<p>It was not at all difficult to guess what Adrian could
be thinking of, and became still less so as the days
slipped by and his infatuation for Miss Olga Duffle
led to her inclusion in innumerable games of tennis
and impromptu tea-parties at St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>“What can he <i>see</i> in her?” Valeria demanded, after
the fashion of sisters.</p>

<p>Quentillian was unable to provide any adequate explanation
of the phenomenon, but he was fully prepared
to discuss it, and prolong thereby the sense of intimacy
with Valeria.</p>

<p>It seemed to Quentillian that a new, slight, tinge
of gravity shadowed Valeria’s frankness.</p>

<p>With all the logic and consistency of most persons
so situated, Quentillian alternately viewed this as being
hopeful or unhopeful, in the extreme, for the fulfilment
of his wishes.</p>

<p>He was slightly amused at finding himself in the
extremely conventional position in which he had so
often viewed, with dispassionate distaste, the spectacle
presented by other men, and this amusement was not
without its share in determining him to submit his
proposal to Valeria in writing.</p>

<p>A tendency, real, or fancied by Quentillian’s self-consciousness,
on the parts of Flora and Adrian at
least, to vacate any room in which he and Valeria
might be, upon excuses of a shadow-like transparency,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
finally brought Quentillian to the point of leaving St.
Gwenllian, under promise of an early return.</p>

<p>“You must come back, to us, dear Owen—you must
come back,” the Canon repeated. “I want many a talk
with you yet, and Adrian here will miss the evening
confabulations in the smoking-room—eh, Adrian?
Stear will hardly be ready for you yet awhile, to our
advantage be it spoken, so you must make your home
with us in the meanwhile. Come and go quite freely,
dear lad.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>Quentillian felt that he had already said these words
all too often, and conscientiously sought to vary the
formula.</p>

<p>“It’s been a delightful time altogether, and I’m more
than grateful. It’s been wonderful to get such a kind
welcome after these years abroad.”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear fellow!”</p>

<p>The Canon’s fine face softened as he laid his arm
across the younger man’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Never doubt your welcome here, Owen,” he said.</p>

<p>Owen suspected significance in the words, and then
derided himself.</p>

<p>Whatever his certainties as regarded the Canon, it
was with Valeria that Quentillian was concerned, and
he could augur nothing from her frank and cordial
regret at his departure.</p>

<p>“I shall write to you, Val.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do. And I’ll tell you what happens with
Adrian and that Olga.”</p>

<p>“I hope nothing will happen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—but it’s amusing.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>She did not look amused. Something of her ripe-apricot
bloom had faded, and there were shadows beneath
her brown eyes. Before he left St. Gwenllian,
Owen said rather earnestly to Lucilla that he thought
Valeria looked tired.</p>

<p>“So do I.”</p>

<p>“Is she ill?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“I should hate to think of her being ill.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think she’s ill, Owen.”</p>

<p>Lucilla evidently accepted his solicitude as a natural
thing.</p>

<p>“I’ve always thought that Val needed a greater outlet
for her energies than she gets here. She’s very
strong, really, and she did splendidly in France when
she was working so hard at her Canteen. I wish
she could go away and work again.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think so yourself?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps—if she wished it very much. There are
other things besides work, though,” said Owen Quentillian.</p>

<p>“Well—” Lucilla’s favourite monosyllable held, as
usual, a sound of concession.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t one do anything for her—take care of her,
somehow?”</p>

<p>“I will order a cup of beef-tea for her at eleven
o’clock,” said Lucilla with seriousness, but with amusement
lurking in her eyes.</p>

<p>They parted upon a mutual smile of excellent understanding.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Quentillian thought that he liked Lucilla, with her
impersonal calm, and her unquestioning acceptances.</p>

<p>He wrote to Valeria from London, letters that he felt
to be self-conscious, and received uneloquent replies.
He had left St. Gwenllian a fortnight when he finally
composed an epistle that left him a little—a very little—less
than profoundly dissatisfied with his own powers
of composition. He received her reply by return of
post.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Owen, dear, I’ve got your letter. I can’t answer
it in the way I should like to, making you understand
everything that I mean. But do understand first of
all that your thinking of me like that makes me very
proud, and I wish I was more worth it all.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you loved someone else before, and thank
you for telling me. The reason I’m glad is because
I used to like someone very much myself once, but
it wasn’t like yours, it was only my own foolishness,
and never came to anything. But I think perhaps it’s
prevented my falling really in love, because, dear Owen,
I am not in love with you. If I married you, it would
be because you are, as you say, very lonely, and because
I am very, very fond of you, and also perhaps, a
little, because it would make Father so happy. But
none of those reasons are <i>the</i> real, true reason for
marrying, are they?</p>

<p>“We have known one another so long, and understand
one another. Can’t we discuss it honestly together,
before settling anything? Either way, we are
always friends, so I will sign myself your friend.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Valeria Morchard.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Quentillian read the letter with a strange mingling
of disappointment, relief, and mortification.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was in all sincerity that he wrote
to Val of his admiration for her candour.</p>

<p>“You and I are moderns, my dear. Let us, as you
wish, discuss the future impersonally, but let me first
of all say that when—or if—ever you should come
to the decision which I want you to come to, then so
far as I am concerned, philosophical discussion will
go for nothing. I shall wait for your sign, Val, and
if it comes, there shall be no more pen and ink between
us, but a meeting for which I long with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“Academic,” said Owen’s inner monitor, relentless
as ever.</p>

<p>He posted his letter in spite of it.</p>

<p>It was with relief, and yet with a happiness less
defined than he had expected it to be, that Quentillian
found himself engaged to Valeria.</p>

<p>He regretted his own absence of ardour, and was
all the time aware of a faint, lurking gratification at
having so early outlived the illusions of passionate
emotion.</p>

<p>He returned to St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>This time it was Valeria who met him. Something
in the simplicity with which she accepted their new
relationship touched him profoundly, and rendered of
no account his own temperamental subtleties.</p>

<p>It was with a deepening sense of sincerity that Quentillian
said to her:</p>

<p>“You have made me very happy, dearest.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, Owen. I’m happy too.”</p>

<p>Her hand lay trustfully in his.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“They want to see you so much, at home, Owen.
I’ve told them. They’re all so pleased.”</p>

<p>It evidently added to Valeria’s content, that it should
be so.</p>

<p>“You know that Father has always really looked
upon you as another son, even in the days when you
and I got into trouble for playing at Greek sacrificial
processions with the guinea pigs on silver salvers.”</p>

<p>They laughed together at the recollection.</p>

<p>The Canon had not been hard upon the classically-minded
delinquents.</p>

<p>Quentillian believed himself to have realized fully
the adjuncts, necessary and fitting in the eyes of the
Morchard family, but to himself distasteful in the
extreme, of his engagement to Valeria.</p>

<p>He was prepared for conventional congratulations,
for the abhorrent necessity of discussing his personal
affairs, for an emotional absence of reticence that would
differ as widely from his own impersonal, dissecting-room
outspokenness as would the Canon’s effusive
periods from Quentillian’s cultivated terseness of expression.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was less well-armoured, or more
severely tried, than he had expected to be.</p>

<p>Canon Morchard seemed to shower welcome, blessings,
congratulations upon him. He said:</p>

<p>“Dear lad, you and I must have a long talk together,
at no distant date.”</p>

<p>They had many.</p>

<p>It seemed to Quentillian that he saw more of the
Canon than of Valeria, in the days that ensued.</p>

<p>“Val, when will you marry me? I’m quite selfish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
enough to want you to myself,” Quentillian said to her
with firmness after a week at St. Gwenllian that
seemed to him to have been mainly differentiated from
his last visit there by the increased number of one-sided
talks with the Canon to which he had been subjected.</p>

<p>Val said tentatively: “The end of January?”</p>

<p>“Why not before Christmas? Stear should be quite
ready for us by then.”</p>

<p>It relieved him with a strange intensity to know
that he would not, after all, go alone to Stear.</p>

<p>Valeria looked at him, and although her voice when
she spoke was serious, a certain mischievous amusement
lurked in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Before Christmas, it’s Advent,” she said.</p>

<p>“Advent?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Father would like my wedding to be
during Advent, at all.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be vexed, Owen. It’s only a month’s difference
after all.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” began Quentillian candidly, and then
shared in her slight, unoffended laughter at his lack
of gallantry.</p>

<p>“I only mean, my dear, that I don’t like to see you
bound by that sort of convention. Do you really think
it can make any difference if we’re married on one particular
date rather than another?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking entirely of Father,” gently said Val,
thus altogether evading the real point at issue.</p>

<p>Quentillian was again and again made aware of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
capacity in Val for the avoidance of any discussion
between them on the subject of religion.</p>

<p>It was as though the faint rebellion that he had
discerned in her at her own way of life had been extinguished
by the mere prospect of its coming to an
end. Nor, when he finally forced an issue, did Val
appear to possess his own capacities for impartial,
essentially impersonal, discussion.</p>

<p>“Can’t we leave it alone, Owen? You told me what
your views were—and you know what mine are.
We’ve been honest with one another—isn’t that all that
matters?”</p>

<p>“In a sense, of course it is. You don’t think that
perhaps it’s a pity to know there’s one subject we must
tacitly avoid—that we can’t discuss freely?”</p>

<p>He spoke without emphasis of any kind.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a pity, of course,” said Val literally. “But how
can we help it? I can hardly listen to you without disloyalty
of the worst kind. If you look at it from my
point of view for a moment, you do see that, don’t
you, Owen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I do see that,” he said heavily.</p>

<p>He felt strangely disappointed and disillusioned.</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to say anything to your father
about that?”</p>

<p>Val blushed deeply, but spoke quite resolutely.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. I’ve thought it over, and I can’t see
that it concerns anyone but you and me. Lucilla says
so, too. I asked her what she thought. It’s not as
though I were eighteen, and it’s not as though I didn’t
trust you, absolutely, not to interfere with my beliefs,
any more than I with your—unbeliefs.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Confronted with her grave trustfulness, no less than
with the obvious justice of her words, Quentillian could
only agree with her.</p>

<p>His rather arrogant conviction of earlier days, that
Val’s beliefs must go, gave place to an unescapable certainty
that they would not even be modified. Rather
would Valeria, enforced by tradition and by the inherited
faith that was in her, expect with the course
of years to influence her husband’s views.</p>

<p>Owen felt strongly the hopelessness of such expectation,
and still more strongly the inexpediency, not to
say the impossibility, of urging that hopelessness upon
Valeria.</p>

<p>It was decided that the wedding should take place in
January, and the engagement be made public just before
Christmas.</p>

<p>“You do not want to let the world in upon your
joy too soon, young people,” the Canon told them with
a grave smile.</p>

<p>Val’s answering smile acquiesced in the assumption,
as indeed the smiles and silences, no less than the
spoken words, of his entire family were always apt to
acquiesce in any assumption made by Canon Morchard,
whether the facts warranted such acquiescence or not.</p>

<p>The days slipped by, very much as they had slipped
by before Quentillian and Valeria had become engaged.
If Quentillian had expected a greater difference, a more
profound element, he was destined to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Val was charming and—he would not have to face
loneliness at Stear.</p>

<p>Indeed at one moment, it almost appeared as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Valeria would not be alone in accomplishing the destruction
of the spirit of solitude at Stear.</p>

<p>Adrian Morchard sought his prospective brother-in-law,
and said, with singularly ill-chosen colloquialism:</p>

<p>“Tell me, old thing, have you had any talk with the
governor about that living at Stear?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. The present incumbent hasn’t even resigned.”</p>

<p>“I suppose—ha-ha—you’ll laugh—in fact I shouldn’t
be surprised if you thought it dashed funny—it makes
me smile myself, in a way—you’ll <i>roar</i> when I tell you
what I’m thinking of.”</p>

<p>Quentillian felt as melancholy as do the majority
of people thus apostrophised, and was aware that his
melancholy was reflected on his face in a forbidding
expression.</p>

<p>Adrian had turned rather pale.</p>

<p>“You know the old man’s always been desperately
keen on my going into the Church? Well—I say, you
can laugh as much as you want to, I shan’t be offended—I’m
not at all sure I shan’t do it.”</p>

<p>Quentillian felt no inclination whatever to indulge in
the prescribed orgy of merriment.</p>

<p>“You coming into the family like this, with a good
living going begging, makes it a pretty obvious move
in a way, doesn’t it—and then it’d please the old man
frightfully—and really there are precious few openings
for a man who hasn’t been brought up to anything
special, nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And what is the real reason?”</p>

<p>Adrian laughed uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Sherlock Holmes! Well, between ourselves, I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
mind telling you that I want to see some prospect of
being able to marry, and if I had a definite thing in
view, like Stear, I might be able to bring it off.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be ordained in five minutes. Don’t be
absurd.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to wait, anyhow,” said Adrian gloomily.
“She won’t even be engaged, yet. I thought I might
as well fill in the time at Cambridge or somewhere,
if it’s going to lead to something. I’m quite willing to
wait if I must, and of course I shall never change.”</p>

<p>“It’s Miss Duffle, I suppose. I can’t say I should
have thought she’d enjoy the life of a country parson’s
wife.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t the least idea of what she’s really
like.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.” Owen’s voice implied the contrary.
“What about yourself? Do you really suppose you
could stand it?”</p>

<p>“Of course I could, if it meant <i>her</i>. My dear fellow,
my mind’s <i>absolutely</i> made up, I may tell you, and has
been for—for days. But, of course,” he added ingenuously,
“it does depend a good deal on whether
you’ll promise me Stear or not at the end of it all.”</p>

<p>“What about your father?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll jump at it, of course. It’s been the one
wish of his heart, all along,” said Adrian easily.</p>

<p>Quentillian wondered how it was possible that any
youth, brought up in the intellectual atmosphere of St.
Gwenllian, could be so entirely devoid of insight. To
his own way of thinking, it was utterly incredible that
Canon Morchard, ardent Christian and idealist, should
contemplate with any degree of equanimity, his son’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
proposed flippant adoption of a vocation which he regarded
as sacred.</p>

<p>Owen committed himself to no promises.</p>

<p>“I should like to talk it over with Val.”</p>

<p>“I suppose if you must you must,” said Adrian,
grudgingly. “But don’t let her tell anyone else.”</p>

<p>Valeria’s views were not far removed from Quentillian’s
own.</p>

<p>It sometimes, indeed, seemed to Owen that the identity
of their points of view on every other subject only
rendered more evident the deep gulf dividing them on
the topic that Valeria had decreed should be a barred
one—that of religion.</p>

<p>Spoken, their very difference might have brought
them closer together. Unspoken, it seemed to Owen
to pervade all their intercourse since their engagement
as it had never done before.</p>


<h3>(vi)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Valeria</span> had been engaged for nearly a month when
she wrote a letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Captain Cuscaden</span>,</p>

<p>“I thought I would like to tell you myself that I am
engaged to be married. It is to Owen Quentillian,
whom I have known all my life, almost, and we hope
to be married in January.</p>

<p>“I hope you will have very good luck in Canada, and
that you will sometimes let us know how you get on.
We are expecting you on Saturday, to come and say
good-bye.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours sincerely,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Valeria Morchard</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Val spent a long while over the composition of her
brief letter, re-read it a great number of times, and
finally tore it up very carefully into small pieces.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” she said.</p>

<p>Captain Cuscaden, however, did not seem to have
been dependent upon Valeria for news of Valeria’s
engagement. He congratulated her formally on the
Saturday afternoon when he came to pay his farewell
visit to St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>Olga Duffle was there, too, and Miss Admaston.</p>

<p>“No more tennis this year. It’s going to rain again,”
said Flora.</p>

<p>“Here it comes,” Mr. Clover pointed out.</p>

<p>“It may clear up later—let’s have tea.”</p>

<p>After tea the rain was still falling heavily.</p>

<p>“How are all you young folks going to amuse yourselves?”
genially enquired the Canon. “Lucilla, can
you not organize some of our old <i>jeux d’esprit</i>, with
pencil and paper?”</p>

<p>There was an inarticulate protest from the Captain,
to which no one paid any attention except Valeria, who
heard it, and Olga, who replied to it: “I’ll help you,
Dzorze, if you’re very good.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clover was zealous in finding paper and pencils.</p>

<p>“I can’t resist this,” said the Canon boyishly. “I
must give some of my old favourites a turn before
going to more serious affairs. Now what is it to be?”</p>

<p>No one appeared to be very ready with suggestions.
Captain Cuscaden was gloomily gazing out of the
window. Olga and Adrian were talking in undertones,
and Miss Admaston was telling Quentillian how very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
much she dreaded and disliked any games that required
the use of brains.</p>

<p>“Are we all ready?” said Mr. Clover joyously.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’re as ready as we ever shall be,” said
Captain Cuscaden.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, they began.</p>

<p>Canon Morchard, Lucilla, and Owen Quentillian
outmatched the rest of the players with ease. Each
seemed to think with promptitude of great men whose
names started with A, battles that began with M, or
quotations—English—of which the initial letter
was W.</p>

<p>They challenged one another’s references, and verified
one another’s dates. They capped quotations, and
they provided original <i>bouts rimés</i>.</p>

<p>The entertainment gradually resolved itself into one
animated trio, with a faithful but halting chorus, in
the persons of Mr. Clover and Flora, and a rapid and
low-toned aside between Adrian and Miss Duffle.</p>

<p>Captain Cuscaden played a listless game of noughts
and crosses with Miss Admaston, and Valeria leant
back in her chair and ceased to pretend that she was
occupied.</p>

<p>She looked at the sapphire and diamond ring on her
finger, and thought about Owen’s cleverness. She remembered
that Lucilla had said he would be a difficult
person to live with. She remembered her own secret
desires for a life of work, and her assurance to herself
that such ambitions were out of place. She reminded
herself that her father had been, in his own
parlance, glad beyond words to welcome Owen Quentillian
as a son. And she looked at Owen himself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
saw him intent, over his little slips of paper, and a sudden
rush of tenderness came over her. His absorption
in the game seemed to make him younger, and
in more need of her. She could remember Owen as
a flaxen-haired, solemn, rather priggish little boy, and
she suddenly felt that perhaps he had not changed a
very great deal since those days, after all.</p>

<p>Val felt happier, in a subdued and wistful way. She
woke to the realization that the games were ended.</p>

<p>The Canon had arisen.</p>

<p>“Look up that derivation, Clover, dear man, and
let me have it. I shall be curious.... Fare ye
well, young people, I recommend Lucilla here as a
veritable dictionary of dates, if you wish to continue
your amusement.”</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more evident, the moment
the Canon had left the room, than that no one wished
to pursue amusement on the lines indicated.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Clover joined in the general movement
that thankfully relinquished paper and pencil, and sent
everyone to the piano, flung open by Olga Duffle.</p>

<p>“Do play something,” Adrian pleaded.</p>

<p>“Oh, not me. Make your sister play. She plays so
much better than I do.”</p>

<p>It was indubitably true that Flora played a great
deal better than did Olga, yet nobody seemed to want
Flora to play the piano, and Olga, even as she protested,
slipped on to the music stool and ran her small
fingers over the keys.</p>

<p>“I say, how well you do everything!” Adrian murmured
ecstatically above her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>She looked up at him and smiled, showing all her
little pointed teeth.</p>

<p>They clustered round her.</p>

<p>“Do you know ‘Oh, Kiss Me and I’ll Never Tell,’
that comes in that revue—I forget it’s name—the new
one? It’s lovely.”</p>

<p>To the perceptions of Valeria Morchard, trained in
the eclectic school of the Canon’s taste, the musical
inspiration in question was not only undeserving of
being called lovely, but was vulgar to the point of
blatancy, ringing through the St. Gwenllian drawing-room
in Olga’s little, high, soprano voice.</p>

<p>She was not at all surprised that Owen should look
at her through his <i>pince-nez</i> with eyebrows expressively
elevated, nor that Mr. Clover, presumably in a futile
endeavour to spare the Canon’s ears, should unobtrusively
go and shut the door.</p>

<p>Val looked at Lucilla.</p>

<p>There was something not at all unlike amusement
on Miss Morchard’s face, but Val did not think that
it was caused by the humour of “Oh, Kiss Me and I’ll
Never Tell.” Rather it might have been born of a
gentle irony, embracing alike the puzzled distaste of
Flora, the obvious terror of the curate lest he should
be supposed to be enjoying the entertainment, the absorption
with which Captain Cuscaden, Adrian, and
even Miss Admaston stood and listened, the supercilious
detachment of Owen Quentillian, the complacent
unconsciousness of the small, pert singer at the piano.
No doubt Lucilla could have detected, had she cared to
do so, the unspecified emotions that Val suspected of
being written upon her own unsmiling face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>She felt suddenly impatient.</p>

<p>“We’re all intolerable. Lucilla is superior, and
Flossie takes this rubbish <i>au grand serieux</i>, like a
crime, and Owen is thinking how deplorable it is that
idiotic words should be set to inferior music, and put
before the British public for its education.... I
can hear exactly what he’ll say about it afterwards.”</p>

<p>It struck her that the anticipation scarcely boded well
for a life that was in future to be spent in Quentillian’s
company.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“My dusky gal is black as coal</div>
<div class="verse">“But she’s just the whitest, brightest soul.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>carolled Olga.</p>

<p>“I love the darky girls, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Rather.”</p>

<p>“Why does the English youth of today seek artistic
inspiration from the uncivilized population of Central
Africa, I wonder?” said Owen Quentillian. He addressed
himself to Lucilla, but his very distinct utterance
was perfectly audible to everybody else.</p>

<p>Captain Cuscaden laughed, and Olga looked round
with perfect good humour. It was Adrian who glared
at Quentillian, and Mr. Clover who observed reproachfully:</p>

<p>“I’m sure those old plantation songs are charming,
<i>as</i> Miss Olga renders them.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t be so superior, Owen,” said Lucilla
tranquilly.</p>

<p>It was what Val had been thinking, but she had
found herself quite unable to say it, from the very
intensity of her feeling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Lucilla placed an old album on the music stand, and
they all began to sing together “Comin’ through the
Rye.”</p>

<p>The music affected Valeria almost intolerably.</p>

<p>All the Morchards had good voices, and both Flora
and Lucilla sang well. Their true, deep voices gradually
dominated Olga’s high pipe, and the four men
sank to a mere murmur of accompaniment. Miss Admaston
had never done more than crane over everybody’s
shoulder in turn in an endeavour to see the
page at close quarters, and murmur the last words of
a verse in an undertone when everyone else was singing
the first line of the refrain. She was now altogether
silent.</p>

<p>“Sing the Russian songs, Flora,” said Quentillian.</p>

<p>Valeria pressed her hands closer together, and leant
against the wall.</p>

<p>It was growing dark.</p>

<p>The air of the Russian song that Flora chose was
wild and sweet.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“You are my darling, you are my soul</div>
<div class="verse">Light of my life, my sun, my goal ...</div>
<div class="verse">You are my being, my delight</div>
<div class="verse">Star of my darkest night.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Direct, primitive worship of one man for one
woman: Flora’s voice held all the passion that was not
in her, save at her music.</p>

<p>The ache at Val’s heart seemed to her physical in
its intensity.</p>

<p>She knew what she wanted, now, and she knew that
Owen Quentillian would not give it her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>To her own horror, a rush of tears blinded her.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“But all is well for thou art with me</div>
<div class="verse">“The world is full of only thee.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang Flora.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” said the low, troubled voice
of Cuscaden beside her.</p>

<p>Val started violently.</p>

<p>“Val, you <i>must</i> tell me. What is it...?”</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>It suddenly became the thing that mattered most in
the world that Val Morchard and George Cuscaden
should speak alone to one another.</p>

<p>Regardless of the rain pouring outside, Valeria
gently opened the French window behind her.</p>

<p>“Come outside. I must speak to you,” she said urgently.</p>

<p>She had no idea what she was going to say.</p>

<p>Outside, in the rapidly gathering darkness, the rain
fell in torrents and splashed up from the ground
against the stone step of the low veranda that ran
round the house.</p>

<p>Cuscaden stepped out of the warm room and closed
the window again behind him. It was as though he
had shut them out of the world of music and companionship,
into some colder, more virile atmosphere.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“But all is well for thou art with me</div>
<div class="verse">“The world is full of only thee.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Flora’s song reached them as faintly as possible,
and neither heeded it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>They faced one another, and Val found that she
was shivering from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Why do I never get a chance of speaking to you
nowadays?” said Captain Cuscaden violently.</p>

<p>“You could have,” said Valeria, and her voice broke.</p>

<p>His arms went round her.</p>

<p>“Val, Val, I love you so.”</p>

<p>It was as though Quentillian had never existed.</p>

<p>“And you’re going to Canada,” she wailed.</p>

<p>“You’re coming with me.”</p>

<p>“I must,” Val said, and surrendered herself to his
kisses.</p>

<p>“My daughter, how wet you are!” exclaimed the
Canon.</p>

<p>His daughter, hastening to her own room, paused
under the light of a lamp, and inadvertently thereby
gave the Canon an opportunity of verifying his statement.</p>

<p>Val, beneath his astonished gaze, became acutely
aware that her rain-wet hair was disordered, her face
flaming, and showing all the marks of recent and violent
weeping.</p>

<p>“What is all this?” the Canon enquired rather
sternly.</p>

<p>Valeria felt utterly incapable of replying.</p>

<p>“Answer me, Valeria.”</p>

<p>“Captain Cuscaden is looking for you,” said Valeria
almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“Captain Cuscaden?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>They gazed speechlessly at one another.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>A weight had descended upon the Canon’s brow and
the lines round his mouth were set sternly.</p>

<p>“Valeria, has he insulted you?”</p>

<p>The intimate conviction overwhelmed her that the
Canon’s opinion of her recent interview with Captain
Cuscaden would certainly demand an emphatically affirmative
reply to the enquiry. She felt a purely
hysterical desire to burst out laughing at the thought.</p>

<p>“How is Captain Cuscaden concerned with you?
If it is as I think, Valeria, you did well to refer him
to me.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t. He—I—we are both to blame, Father.
I’m going to break off my engagement to Owen. I
love George.”</p>

<p>The words were said, and although Valeria broke
into a flood of tears, it was with a sense of relief.
Telling Owen that she did not intend to marry him
after all, was, she honestly felt, nothing to telling the
Canon so.</p>

<p>She sank down on the stairs and hid her face in her
hands, afraid to face her father’s realization of the
implication that her words contained.</p>

<p>It did not tarry.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to understand that you are under
a solemn engagement to marry Owen Quentillian, and
that you have at the same time been allowing—encouraging—the
clandestine attentions of this—this
<i>fellow</i>? You, my daughter, behaving like a wanton?
I won’t believe it—I can’t believe it—” the Canon’s
voice rose violently. “Valeria, for God’s sake tell me
I’m mistaken—don’t crouch there like a guilty creature—tell
me I’m wrong, tell me you’re the pure, honest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
maiden I’ve tried to make you and not—not—a
creature without honour, without decency——”</p>

<p>The rising note of anguish broke on a strangled sob.</p>

<p>Below, a door was shut sharply.</p>

<p>“Get up,” said the Canon with violence.</p>

<p>Valeria rose, and he pulled her to her feet and
gazed searchingly into her face.</p>

<p>“And this is my child!” said the Canon, and in his
turn dropped his face into his hands, groaning.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it,” she spoke between her sobs, like
a child. “Owen knew I wasn’t in love with him
... only I never realized, I didn’t know George
cared, too—it was always him....”</p>

<p>“Stop!” thundered the Canon. “Are you without
shame, Valeria? Is that fellow waiting for me downstairs,
or has he crawled away as I should expect,
from one who has so repaid my hospitality?”</p>

<p>The words gave Valeria a needed impetus.</p>

<p>“He is ready to meet you, Father—he went to find
you. And I love him—I suppose I’ve been very dishonourable,
but I—I believe Owen will understand.”</p>

<p>She broke into tears again, and left him.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with the sense of her own dishonour,
regarding the Canon’s wrath as might have a child, in
the light of the greatest calamity that life could present,
she turned with absolute relief to the thought of
Owen’s dispassionate judgments, his studiously impersonal
attitude towards life. Owen would understand.</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Val, may I come in?”</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Valeria unwillingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Lucilla entered the room, unperturbed, but fully accepting
the disordered aspect of its occupant.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Val, that the drawing-room door was
open, and it was impossible to help hearing Father. I
thought you’d rather know, in case you wanted to
speak to Owen.”</p>

<p>“Owen knows?” almost shrieked Valeria.</p>

<p>“I suppose he does. He must have drawn his own
conclusions.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it,” said Val again. “I never meant
anything like that to happen—it’s George Cuscaden,
Lucilla. It was always him, indeed it was, only I
didn’t know it, and it all seemed to happen in a minute—it
was stronger than either of us.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you did quite right. Why don’t you
wash, Val?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lucilla, how like you!”</p>

<p>Valeria laughed shakily, but she followed her sister’s
advice.</p>

<p>Lucilla methodically produced Val’s brush and comb,
and dry clothing.</p>

<p>“Maud Admaston and Miss Duffle have gone, and
Adrian went with them. Mr. Clover has gone, too, so
it was only Owen and Flossie and I that heard.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say anything. Shall I fasten you up,
Val?”</p>

<p>“Lucilla—what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“Tell Owen you can’t marry him, and tell George
you will marry him.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was as simple as that! You always take
things so literally.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Well,” said Lucilla unmoved, “I don’t see any
other way of taking this. You can’t be engaged to
two people at once. You know—Owen will understand.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I feel,” said Val to her own surprise.
“But Father—Father will never, never understand.”</p>

<p>“Probably not. But after all, it’s you, and Owen,
and George, isn’t it, that are concerned? I shouldn’t
let there be scenes and upsets about it, Val, if I were
you—really I shouldn’t. Why don’t you just see Owen
tonight, and tell him about it, and then you and he
and George could all talk it over quietly tomorrow
morning?”</p>

<p>Val was conscious of profound astonishment and
also of extreme relief.</p>

<p>“Do you think one could? But Father——”</p>

<p>“You needn’t go downstairs again. I quite understand
that you don’t want to see Father again tonight.
Shall I tell Owen to come up here?”</p>

<p>“Here? How could he, in my bedroom?”</p>

<p>“Goodness me, child, you may just as well be hung
for a sheep as a lamb, surely. But if you think it’s
so dreadful, I suppose you can come out on the landing
and speak to him.”</p>

<p>Impossible to disconcert Lucilla!</p>

<p>Val assented to the surprising propositions so matter-of-factly
delivered.</p>

<p>“Yes, tell Owen to come up. I’d better get it over.
But Lucilla—George——”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to see him, or give him a message?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“I want to know what Father says to him,” Val
said faintly.</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll ask Father if George has gone.”</p>

<p>“And, oh, Lucilla! I know you can’t prevent it,
really, but if only you could make Father not come
up to me tonight! I can’t bear any more—indeed I
can’t.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lucilla, “you’d better lock the door
then.” She took the key from the lock, put it on the
inside of the door and tried it in a practical manner.
“That’s all right. You can lock it on the inside as
soon as Owen has gone.”</p>

<p>She went downstairs, but turned and came up again
the next moment.</p>

<p>“I’ll have dinner sent up to you, shall I?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any.”</p>

<p>“I should think you’d better have something, Val.
I’ll send up soup and chicken. The pudding is only
ginger, and you know how badly she makes ginger pudding.”</p>

<p>Lucilla departed in earnest, upon this prosaic pronouncement.</p>

<p>She was succeeded by Owen Quentillian, and Val
went out upon the landing to meet him.</p>

<p>“Will you forgive me, Owen? I can’t marry you.”</p>

<p>“What has happened?”</p>

<p>“I thought you knew,” she said piteously.</p>

<p>“I suppose I do. Is it Cuscaden?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then why,” Owen demanded in reasonable accents,
“couldn’t he have proposed to you himself without
waiting for you to be engaged to me?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“He thought he couldn’t ask me to go to Canada—and
he’s badly off—and then, when you came, he—he
thought it was you I cared about.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Quentillian dryly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I knew, exactly, that I still cared for
him, and I was sure he hadn’t meant anything, and it—it
was really all over—only then—Flora’s music,
somehow—and he asked me what it was—and I cried.
Owen, won’t you forgive me? Surely it’s better than
if I’d tried to go on with it?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is.”</p>

<p>They looked at one another rather helplessly.</p>

<p>“Val, if I can do anything to help you, of course
I will. What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I can’t think,” said Valeria faintly.</p>

<p>“When does Cuscaden sail?”</p>

<p>“Next week.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad luck,” said Owen impartially. “Look
here, my dear, you must be tired out. Won’t you go
and sleep now, and in the morning we could see what’s
to be done?”</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you are!”</p>

<p>He frowned slightly.</p>

<p>“Surely the day of heroics is over. I haven’t the
slightest desire to exchange pistol-shots with Captain
Cuscaden, I assure you. We are three reasonable human
beings, and we find ourselves in a difficulty from
which only clear thinking and absolute plain speaking
can extricate us. You may believe me when I tell
you that I am perfectly prepared to discuss the case
upon its own merits.”</p>

<p>Valeria could believe him without difficulty. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
in the midst of her distress, she could not altogether
stifle a slight suspicion that Owen was appreciating the
opportunity afforded him of being thoroughly modern
and rational.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Father?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>Quentillian’s tone betrayed no great eagerness for
the prospective interview.</p>

<p>“He is very, very angry with me, and I know he
has every right to be. But indeed, Owen, I was coming
straight to you, only I met him first, and it somehow
came out. George was going to tell him.”</p>

<p>“Your father has never liked Captain Cuscaden,”
said Quentillian meditatively. “I am afraid he will
make things very difficult.”</p>

<p>“I deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd,” said Quentillian, with severity.
“This is that foolish idea of atonement and repentance—and
all the other cheap salves to the humiliation of
having made a mistake. Don’t you see that it’s all
waste of time and energy, Val? You ought to be
thinking of what you’re going to do next, and how
you can do it with least wear and tear for us all. Life
isn’t a series of sins and punishments or virtues and
rewards, as it is in one’s nursery story-books. There
are actions and their consequences—that’s all.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him, bewildered, and yet slightly
relieved at perceiving that he still possessed the power
of sententiousness.</p>

<p>“Only say you forgive me, Owen.”</p>

<p>“If you wish it, my dear, of course. Please don’t
cry any more.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Valeria, however, crying more than ever, drew the
sapphire and diamond ring from her finger and mutely
held it out to him.</p>

<p>Owen gazed at it for a moment through his <i>pince-nez</i>.</p>

<p>Then he put it gently back into her hand again, and
closed her fingers round it with his own.</p>

<p>“Please, Val.”</p>

<p>Still holding her hand, he bent forward and very
softly kissed her wet cheek.</p>

<p>“If we’re not engaged any more, we’ve got to go
back to what we were before—brother and sister, Val.
Good-night—don’t cry any more.”</p>

<p>The smile with which he left her was in his eyes
as well as on his lips, and held nothing so much as
very gentle amusement, and an affectionate concern.</p>


<h3>(vii)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> amusement was no longer to be seen in the eyes
of Quentillian, and the concern had no affinity with affectionateness,
when he reached the door of the Canon’s
study.</p>

<p>He felt himself to be eleven years old once more,
and in complete uncertainty as to the manner in which
he might be received, after the discovery of some unwonted
misdemeanour.</p>

<p>The thunderous voice that bade him come in did
nothing to dispel the unpleasing illusion.</p>

<p>The Canon was sitting at the writing-table, under
the carved crucifix that hung against the green velvet
plaque. A blotting pad, deeply scored with heavy black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
lines, lay beneath his hand, and a broken lead pencil
testified to the energy with which that hand had sought
an outlet for the feelings that presumably agitated its
owner.</p>

<p>The Canon swung round in his chair as the door
closed behind Quentillian.</p>

<p>“Owen, Owen!” His voice broke. “My boy, how
can I face you?”</p>

<p>The Canon answered his own question by rising
impetuously and leaning heavily upon Quentillian’s
shoulder, one hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>“My dear, dear fellow!”</p>

<p>His voice, charged with emotion, broke horribly over
each fresh ejaculation.</p>

<p>“My son—Owen—you’ve been nothing less to me—and
now—treated like this—one of mine own household—what
can I say, what can I say?”</p>

<p>Quentillian longed heartily to implore the Canon to
say nothing at all.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down, sir? I thought I’d better
come and talk to you, if I may.”</p>

<p>“Anything, anything, dear lad. Have you seen my
unhappy child?”</p>

<p>“Valeria and I have agreed that we are no longer
engaged,” said Owen carefully. “I don’t consider that
I have been unfairly treated. She discovered, rather
before the eleventh hour, that she and Captain Cuscaden
were in love with one another, and it would have
been quite as unjust to me as to herself, if she had not
acted upon the discovery.”</p>

<p>Canon Morchard gazed anxiously at the victim of
this neatly-analysed situation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“For Heaven’s sake, Owen, don’t let yourself become
bitter. It is so easy—so fatally easy, when one
is suffering. Take a stronger grip of your faith than
ever before, dear lad—remember that ‘<i>all</i> things work
together for good.’ One learns to dwell upon those
words, and the meaning deepens into something so
unspeakably precious....”</p>

<p>To Owen’s relief the Canon sank back into his chair
again.</p>

<p>“I can offer you no atonement,” he said presently,
with a deep weariness in his voice.</p>

<p>“I am still unutterably bewildered. How I have
failed, how I have failed, with my motherless girl!
And I thought I knew my child—my merry Valeria,
as I have called her from her babyhood—I thought I
knew her through and through! <i>She</i> to be dishonourable,
<i>she</i> to be heartless, <i>she</i> to attach herself to a
godless, brainless, mannerless fellow—and when a man
like yourself had received her troth! Owen, it is as
though mine own right hand had turned against me.”</p>

<p>The Canon held out a trembling right hand and
gazed upon it.</p>

<p>“Where is Captain Cuscaden now, sir?” enquired
Quentillian, almost expecting to hear that the object
of his solicitude had been bound and cast into outer
darkness.</p>

<p>“Where!” Canon Morchard struck the table with
his clenched fist until the blotting-paper and the broken
pencil bounded again. “Where! I have dismissed
him, Owen. Does he think that I shall give my daughter
to one who comes like a thief in the night? There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
is such a thing as a righteous anger, and such an anger
was mine then.”</p>

<p>It seemed to be his still, Owen reflected, and boded
ill for his own wish to discuss the situation impartially.</p>

<p>“Valeria is very unhappy, sir.”</p>

<p>The Canon groaned.</p>

<p>“I can’t trust myself to see her, to speak to her.
God knows that my place is with my unhappy child,
but my shameful lack of self-control makes me tremble.
I have been angry—I am angry still.”</p>

<p>He looked piteously at Owen.</p>

<p>“I have thought to get the better of my devil with
prayer and fasting, but the old Adam is strong—terribly
strong. When I saw my child—my little Valeria—her
eyes wild, her person disordered, dashing upstairs
as might a shamed creature, to hide itself—when
I realized the depths of her dishonour—Owen, it
was in me to have struck her. I could have raised my
hand against my own child!”</p>

<p>His head sank upon his breast.</p>

<p>Quentillian waited before making a further,
strangely inadequate, contribution to the conversation.</p>

<p>“Do you think, sir, perhaps you may be taking this
too seriously?”</p>

<p>Canon Morchard stared at him. Then he smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>“Generous—very generous, Owen. But I am to be
deceived by no such feint. I, who have had the care
of souls these thirty years! Do you think that, whatever
front you may present to the world, my eyes—<i>mine</i>—are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
to be blinded? Do you think that <i>I</i> do not
know that the iron has entered into your soul?”</p>

<p>The Canon’s eyes were so extraordinarily piercing
as they gazed into Quentillian’s, that the object of his
penetration sought in himself almost hopefully for
some of the searing emotions attributed to him.</p>

<p>He discovered none.</p>

<p>Wounded in his vanity, annoyed, disappointed even,—but
nothing more.</p>

<p>Owen, quite aware of futility, inwardly formed
phrases of complete truthfulness, only to reject them.</p>

<p>“I assure you that I am not in the least unhappy at
having been jilted by your daughter ... it
leaves me quite cold ... I don’t think I ever
really wanted to marry Val very much ... we were
much better friends before we tried to become engaged....”</p>

<p>Or, with a yet more devastating candour:</p>

<p>“I’ve been certain for days that I made a complete
fool of myself by ever proposing marriage to Valeria....”</p>

<p>This surprisingly agile form of mental gymnastics
was tempestuously interrupted by the Canon.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Owen, break down!” he groaned.
“My boy, my boy, you’re safe with me. Forget that
I’m Valeria’s father—think of me only as one who has
known suffering—aye, and sin, too. Make a safety-valve
of me—let yourself go. But I can bear this
sham cynicism of yours no longer. It’s wrong, Owen,
it’s wrong. True fortitude faces what lies before it,
finds its Gethsemane, and rises, purged of bitterness.
Break down—weep, nay, curse if you will, only cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
open the floodgates. Let loose whatever devils possess
your soul, you, the victim of treachery—let them
loose, I say, and we will conquer them together.”</p>

<p>For an instant, all that Quentillian could do hardly
sufficed to prevent his letting loose a violent fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>He drove his teeth into his lower lip. It was his
increasing perception of the Canon’s overwhelming
misery that steadied him.</p>

<p>“Val has hurt me less than you think, sir,” he said
gently at last. “I have sometimes thought that she
and I had made a mistake.”</p>

<p>The Canon gazed at him with a pathetic unbelief.</p>

<p>“My unhappy child does not know what she has
lost.”</p>

<p>“I hope she is going to be happy in her own way,”
said Quentillian.</p>

<p>The Canon’s brow instantly became thunderous
again.</p>

<p>“Not one word, Owen, not one word on those lines,”
he commanded sternly. “I appreciate your generosity
deeply, but there is such a thing as carrying generosity
too far.”</p>

<p>“I can see small generosity in relinquishing to someone
else what is no longer mine.”</p>

<p>The Canon swept on, unheeding.</p>

<p>“My faith in my child has received a rude shock.
Valeria is unfit for wifehood and motherhood. How
can I let her undertake responsibility when she has
proved herself unworthy up to the hilt? No, Owen,
let it rest there. <i>I</i> will deal with Valeria, and may God
help us both!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Quentillian felt inclined to echo the petition whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>He could not doubt that the Canon’s misery was utterly
unfeigned. So, also, was his wrath.</p>

<p>The incongruous sound of the dinner-gong vibrated
violently through the room.</p>

<p>The Canon did not stir.</p>

<p>His voice, when next he spoke, was almost a groan.</p>

<p>“I cannot see Valeria tonight. God forgive me, I
am not master of myself. Your calm shames me,
Owen. But it is not natural, not natural. You will,
and must, suffer for it later on. Tell me, dear fellow—that
I should have to say it!—do you wish to leave us—do
you wish to go?”</p>

<p>Owen wished for nothing so much as an immediate
adjournment to the dining-room, but he felt that it
would indeed be impossible to say so.</p>

<p>“You would not wish me to send Valeria from
home, I know. Nor do I know where I could send
her.”</p>

<p>“Let her marry Cuscaden,” said Quentillian boldly.</p>

<p>“Never, Owen. Give my child—my weak, untrustworthy
child, to a man who could behave as Cuscaden
has behaved? Believe me, I appreciate the generosity
that prompts you, but you know not what you ask—you
know not what you ask.”</p>

<p>Quentillian, entirely unaccustomed to any such accusation,
was silently annoyed.</p>

<p>He was also hungry.</p>

<p>“I have sometimes thought,” said the Canon with
a trembling voice, “that my tendency has been to idolize
my children. I lost their mother so early! You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
know how it was with me, Owen. Lucilla was my
eldest born, my right hand. I have come to depend
upon Lucilla, paradoxical though it may sound, from
a father towards his child. David, my eldest son
...” the Canon paused a long while, and then
murmured softly: “‘Whilst he was yet a great way
off’—David is in a far country, but he will return to
us yet, and though his Morning Prayer be our Evensong,
who shall say that there is separation between
us? And I have kept my other children by my side,
Owen. Little Flora has never yet tried her wings
away from home. She is more like her mother than
any of them—she and the dear Adrian.”</p>

<p>A smile like an illumination came into the Canon’s
eyes as he spoke Adrian’s name. “The light of mine
eyes, that dear lad has always been. My Benjamin!
There are no words for what I went through whilst
Adrian was fighting, Owen. One could only remember
in Whose keeping he was, and that all <i>must</i> be
well, in reality. But all one’s faith was needed—it
must be so, with poor human nature. The soul goes
through dark waters, Owen, as you are finding now.”</p>

<p>The protest which Owen almost automatically registered
within himself at this interpolated reference to
the despair which he could not feel, was necessarily
a silent one.</p>

<p>“Valeria has been the brightest, the most lighthearted,
of all my children. She is naturally gifted
with high spirits, and she and I have made innocent
fun together, have shared the humourous view of life,
a thousand times. Have I allowed that gaiety of hers
to turn to flippancy—that mirthful spirit to cloak a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
lack of principle? I ask myself again and again wherein
I have erred, for I cannot hold myself blameless,
Owen. I have thought over my motherless children,
I have prayed, and yet it has come to this—it has come
to this!”</p>

<p>The Canon’s head dropped back into his hands once
more, and Quentillian felt as though this despairing
round of anger, self-blame, self-pity, and genuine
misery, might go on forever.</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock. The dinner-gong having
failed of its appeal, it appeared as though nothing need
ever interrupt them again.</p>

<p>“I will give him five minutes more, and then I shall
stand up,” Quentillian decided.</p>

<p>The Canon lifted a haggard face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had set my heart overmuch upon your
marriage with my child, Owen. It may be so—it may
be so. I may have forgotten that we poor mortals
cannot, after all, see very far—that all plannings and
schemings are very vain, seen by the light of Immortal
Wisdom. If so, I am receiving my punishment
now.”</p>

<p>The Canon groaned again.</p>

<p>“I am at a loss how to act. I can decide nothing.
I must see Valeria, but how can I do so until I can
command myself?”</p>

<p>Even as he asked the question, the veins stood out
upon the Canon’s forehead, his nostrils quivered and
his face became suffused.</p>

<p>“Three minutes more,” Quentillian reflected.</p>

<p>“Owen, one thing I must ask. Has she asked your
pardon?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Yes, but indeed I don’t think——”</p>

<p>“No, Owen, no.” The Canon raised his hand in
instant protest. “Each generous plea from you, stabs
me afresh. I ask myself if my unhappy child even
knows what she has lost. I thought I knew Valeria
through and through—that nothing in her nature was
hidden from me, from her father. I have been
strangely mistaken, indeed.”</p>

<p>(“Another half minute.”)</p>

<p>“Am I harsh with her, am I harsh to my motherless
girl? God knows that I was angry when I met
her this evening, distraught-looking, crouching before
me like a shamed and terrified creature. I cannot
even now fully understand what has occurred, but her
own admission was that, engaged to you, she believed
herself to love another man—that she had allowed
him to make love to her.”</p>

<p>Owen stood up resolutely.</p>

<p>“Aye, Owen, I do not wonder at it, if you seek the
relief of movement. It is more natural so. I, too, in
my day, have paced this room.”</p>

<p>Quentillian, however, had no desire to pace the room
except for the very few steps that would put him outside
it.</p>

<p>He debated in vain within himself the most tactful
method of making this clear to Canon Morchard.</p>

<p>“I suppose I have been blind. This blow has come
upon me with fearful suddenness—I suspected nothing—nothing.
How could I——”</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>Quentillian looked round thankfully at Lucilla. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
did not go up to her father, but spoke quietly from the
door.</p>

<p>“Father, don’t you think Owen should come to dinner?”</p>

<p>A quick frown drew the Canon’s always formidable
brows together.</p>

<p>“Since when do my children interrupt me in my own
room, at my work, Lucilla?” he enquired.</p>

<p>Her face did not change, but she looked at Quentillian.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said quickly. “I will come.”</p>

<p>The Canon rose. His hand went once more to the
resting-place now rapidly becoming habitual to it—Quentillian’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Do not let my foolish child impose her trivial urgencies
upon you.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s other hand went out towards his
daughter.</p>

<p>“Did I speak over-sharply, my daughter? Perhaps
Mary was nearer my mood than Martha, just now—Martha,
careful and troubled over many things. Go,
then, children. Lucilla, you will come to me later.
Until then, I do not wish to be disturbed again.”</p>

<p>With a heavy sigh, the Canon turned again to his
writing-table.</p>

<p>Owen and Lucilla went out.</p>

<p>“He is terribly upset. Could he not be persuaded
to come to dinner?”</p>

<p>“No, I knew he wouldn’t want that. But I shall
take in a tray when I go to him later. Sometimes, if
he’s talking, he eats without thinking about it. I was
counting on that—and besides, he would have disliked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
my suggesting that he should come in to dinner as
usual.”</p>

<p>Lucilla’s voice and her face alike were entirely
guiltless of irony.</p>

<p>Quentillian followed her into the dining-room:</p>

<p>“The others have finished,” Lucilla said. “Would
you rather I stayed, or that I went?”</p>

<p>“Stay, please.”</p>

<p>She sat down opposite to him at once.</p>

<p>“I wish your father were less angry with poor Val,
although perhaps it is not my place to say so. But in
his—his generous sympathy for me, I am afraid he
has rather lost sight of what she must have been suffering.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think suffering, in my father’s eyes, would
ever condone what he considers wrong-doing.”</p>

<p>The comment seemed to Owen to be rather an illuminating
one.</p>

<p>“I suppose not. It may surprise you to hear that I
do not, personally, consider that Canon Morchard is
entitled either to condemn or condone whatever Valeria
may have done.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you.”</p>

<p>Quentillian was less gratified than astonished at the
assertion.</p>

<p>“Val herself would hardly agree to that.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, but don’t you see, Lucilla, how difficult that’s
going to make things? To my mind, the only natural
proceeding is for Valeria and George Cuscaden to
marry and go to Canada.”</p>

<p>Quentillian paused almost without meaning to, on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
pronouncement that would certainly have met with
drastic and emphatic interruption from Canon Morchard.</p>

<p>Lucilla, however, received it unmoved.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think so?” said Quentillian, slightly disappointed.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But will Valeria do it? Won’t her strange ideas
of filial duty interfere? I am absolutely convinced
that one of the principal reasons for her ever becoming
engaged to me, was her wish to please her father.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was altogether that, Owen. But
you did ask her to marry you at a time when she was
just beginning to realize that the sort of life she led
before the war wasn’t going to be enough for her.”</p>

<p>“Need it have taken a European war to make her
see that?”</p>

<p>The smile that Lucilla turned upon his petulance was
disarming.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so cross, Owen.”</p>

<p>She might have been talking to a little boy.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Quentillian with dignity, “that perhaps
you forget it was only a few hours ago that I
learnt how completely cheated and—fooled, I have
been.”</p>

<p>He could not avoid a recollection that the Canon
would not have needed such a reminder.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I don’t forget at all,” said Lucilla earnestly.
“It must be very vexing for you, but—Owen, do forgive
me for saying that I can’t really feel as if you
minded dreadfully. You’re much too understanding,
really, not to know that poor Val didn’t wilfully cheat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
you, any more than she cheated herself. And I think
you, too, perhaps, in another way, were beginning to
feel that you’d made a mistake in promising to marry
one another.”</p>

<p>Lucilla, Quentillian realized half ruefully and half
with amusement, had beaten him at his own game.
Her unvarnished appraisement of the situation brought
to it no more and no less than the facts warranted.</p>

<p>His answering gaze was as straight as her own.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>She held out her hand with a laden plate in it.</p>

<p>“Pudding?” she enquired, prosaically.</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>He made an excellent dinner.</p>

<p>“But what will happen to us now, Lucilla?”</p>

<p>“Well, George Cuscaden will be here again, and
that’ll make Val feel better. And you’ll help, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>And, on the strange assurance, they separated.</p>

<p>It was much later that Owen, from his own room,
heard the door of the study immediately below him,
open once more, and then shut.</p>

<p>Barely audible, but still unmistakable, he heard a
steady stream of sound, rising and falling, easily to be
identified as the Canon’s voice.</p>

<p>“Good God, what more <i>can</i> he have to say about
it?” reflected Quentillian. He was destined to ask
himself the question again, for the sounds, punctuated
by the briefest of pauses, doubtless consecrated to the
delivery of laconic replies from Lucilla, continued far
into the small hours of the morning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Finally, after Quentillian had fallen asleep, he was
roused by a gentle, reiterated knocking at the door.</p>

<p>Only too well aware whose hand was responsible
for those considerately modified taps, he rose and went
to open the door, omitting the usual invitation to enter.</p>

<p>As he expected, the Canon, unutterably pale and
weary-looking, stood without.</p>

<p>“Dear fellow, I knew that I should find you awake.
Owen, I could not but come to tell you that all is well
with me now. I have forgiven, even as I myself hope—and
need—to be forgiven. I will see Valeria tomorrow,
and tell her that she has my full and free
pardon. Together we will consider what is the best
thing that we can make of this most unhappy business.”</p>

<p>“And Cuscaden, sir?”</p>

<p>Quentillian intended to suggest the inclusion of
Captain Cuscaden in the proposed conference, which
might reasonably be supposed to concern him closely,
but the Canon misunderstood the elliptical reference.</p>

<p>“Aye, Owen, I have no bitterness left in my heart,
even for him. ‘Unto seventy times seven.’ Those
words have been ringing in my ears until I could
almost bring myself to believe that I heard them uttered
aloud. I need not ask if all is well with you,
dear boy? Your self-command and generosity have
shamed me all along.”</p>

<p>The absolute sincerity of the utterance caused Quentillian,
with considerably more reason than the Canon,
to feel ashamed in his turn.</p>

<p>“I am very far from being what you think me, sir,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
he said, earnestly, and with complete truth. “I am
afraid you are very tired.”</p>

<p>The Canon, indeed, looked utterly exhausted.</p>

<p>“If so, it is in my Master’s service,” said Canon
Morchard gently. “And you remember, Owen—‘there
remaineth a rest.’ May it be mine, and yours, too—all
in His own good time! Good-night to you, my
dear.”</p>

<p>For the first time since Owen’s childish days, the
Canon placed his hand upon his head and murmured
a word of blessing.</p>

<p>Then, with a smile as wistful as it was tender, he
turned and went away upstairs.</p>


<h3>(viii)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following day was one of singular discomfort,
and of private interviews that were held to be of the
greatest necessity, in spite of the fact that the participants
always emerged from them in worse plight than
they went in.</p>

<p>The Canon saw Valeria in his study, and she came
out crying.</p>

<p>Valeria sought Flora, and both wept.</p>

<p>Quentillian deliberately demanded an interview from
Captain Cuscaden, but was baffled in his design of a
rational discussion of the three-cornered situation by
Cuscaden’s honest bewilderment at the mere suggestion
of disinterested counsel.</p>

<p>It seemed, indeed, that Captain Cuscaden would
have understood Owen better, and certainly have
thought more highly of him, had the traditional horsewhip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
abhorred of all Owen’s most deeply-rooted prejudices,
held a place in their conversation, at least as
threat, if not as actual fact.</p>

<p>Failing the horsewhip, Cuscaden was inclined to
follow in the wake of the Canon and attribute to
Valeria’s discarded <i>fiancé</i> a spirit of generous heroism
that was even less to Quentillian’s liking.</p>

<p>“Captain Cuscaden takes primitive views,” Quentillian
observed to Lucilla, whom alone he suspected of
summing up the whole situation very much at its true
value.</p>

<p>“Yes, that will suit Val very well.”</p>

<p>“You think she takes primitive views, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Owen realized that, although he had never thought
Valeria subtle, he had at least supposed her to be
capable of appreciating his own subtlety. But subtleties
had not, apparently, really weighed with Val at all.</p>

<p>The sight of her tear-mottled face annoyed Owen’s
æsthetic sense so much, and he felt so sincerely
ashamed of his annoyance, that it constrained him to
absent himself from the house all the afternoon. He
would gladly have left St. Gwenllian altogether and
felt sure that the Canon expected nothing less of him,
but Flora brought him a piteous little message from
Val to beg that he would remain until “something was
settled.”</p>

<p>In the forlorn hope that this had been achieved,
Quentillian returned.</p>

<p>An eager grasp met him almost upon the threshold.</p>

<p>“Owen, dear lad! Where have you been? I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
been uneasy—most uneasy, at your prolonged absence.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, sir.”</p>

<p>“Nay, so long as all is well with you! I should
have had more faith.”</p>

<p>The Canon smiled gravely, and relief was latent in
the smile. Quentillian suddenly realized that Canon
Morchard had not improbably known the sub-conscious
fear of his guest and <i>protégé</i> having sought some
drastic means of ending an existence in the course of
which he had been played so ill a turn.</p>

<p>His sense of his own inadequacy increased every
moment.</p>

<p>“May I know how things stand?” he enquired
abruptly.</p>

<p>“<i>May</i> you? Who has a better right than yourself,
dear Owen? Come you out with me, and let us have a
few words together.”</p>

<p>Owen followed his host.</p>

<p>“It has been a trying day—a sad and trying one.
But I need not tell you <i>that</i>—you, whose grief is so
much greater than mine own, even. Though you,
at least, Owen, have nothing to reproach yourself with,
whereas I am responsible for the weakness in my poor
child which has led to this unhappy state of affairs.
But at least she is fully sensible of error—she knows
what she has done.”</p>

<p>It would be strange indeed if she did not, Owen
reflected, in the universal <i>bouleversement</i> that had
characterized Valeria’s surroundings ever since her
sudden departure from the conventions.</p>

<p>“To my surprise, Lucilla, upon whose judgment I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
place a certain reliance, although it may sound somewhat
odd to hear of a father seeking counsel of his
child—Lucilla advocates my sanctioning her sister’s
marriage. My first instinct was of course to cut her
short at the mention of anything so premature—so—so
lacking in all taste or feeling. But—I hardly
know——”</p>

<p>“There is nothing against Captain Cuscaden, is
there?”</p>

<p>Quentillian made the observation in the simple hope
of expediting the Canon’s decision, but he immediately
perceived that it led him open once more to the imputation
of high-minded generosity.</p>

<p>“I mean to say, he can afford to marry?” he
amended hastily.</p>

<p>“He has satisfied me upon that score,” Canon Morchard
admitted. “I have never desired wealth for my
dear ones, nor have they been brought up to it. Valeria
is not unfitted to become the wife of a poor man. Nay,
had she but acted an honourable and high-minded part
throughout, I should gladly send her forth into the
New World. Valeria has something of the pioneer
spirit, I have always felt.”</p>

<p>He sighed heavily.</p>

<p>“In short, Owen, if, as Lucilla tells me, you share
her own view, then I shall not withhold my consent
to this marriage. The haste is strange and unseemly,
but Captain Cuscaden cannot postpone his departure,
in view of the position awaiting him, and my unhappy
child, left here, would be in a difficult and awkward
situation, nor have I any security, alas, that she has
sufficient discretion to face such a situation.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“It might be difficult for her,” Quentillian admitted.
“Lucilla is looking for us, I think, sir.”</p>

<p>Lucilla was indeed advancing towards them.</p>

<p>The Canon frowned slightly.</p>

<p>“Am I wanted, my child?”</p>

<p>“It was Owen that I wanted, father.”</p>

<p>“My dear, Owen is engaged with me.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Lucilla seemed slightly perplexed, but
quite unruffled. “I know, but the post is just going,
and I thought Owen ought to see this before I send
it to the papers.”</p>

<p>She handed him a sheet of notepaper, upon which he
read a brief and conventionally-worded announcement
to the effect that the marriage arranged between himself
and Valeria Morchard would not take place.</p>

<p>He passed it to the Canon, who groaned.</p>

<p>“Must this be?” he enquired, with some superfluity.</p>

<p>The superfluity seemed to strike himself, for he
added almost at once:</p>

<p>“‘If ’t’were done, ’t’were well ’t’were done quickly’,
no doubt.”</p>

<p>“There is the other announcement to be thought of,”
said Lucilla with merciless common-sense. “If Val is
married at the end of this week, we shall have to put
that in the papers.”</p>

<p>The Canon gave Owen a quick, anxious glance.</p>

<p>“Come into the house, my daughter,” he said to
Lucilla. “We can speak of such matters there.”</p>

<p>Owen understood that Canon Morchard was thinking
of him.</p>

<p>On a sudden impulse he went to seek Valeria.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Look here, my dear, I’d do anything to help you,
but do you really want me to stay on here any longer?
It’s more than I can stand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Owen! I thought you’d forgiven me—I
thought you didn’t mind, so very much, after all,” she
cried in dismay.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind in the least,” Quentillian told her
desperately. “But it’s a false position altogether, and
I want to be out of it.”</p>

<p>“Of course you do, it was very selfish of me to want
to keep you. Only somehow Father is less—dreadful—when
you’re there, Owen. But he’s forgiven me,”
her tears came falling fast, “and I’m going out with
George when he sails, at the beginning of next week.
We shall be married very, very quietly, on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to hear it. Indeed I am, Val. I’m
sure he’s a good fellow, and I hope he’ll make you
very happy.”</p>

<p>She was crying too much to speak, as he went away
from her.</p>

<p>And Quentillian, definitely, could tell himself that
he had no regrets in relinquishing Valeria.</p>

<p>Her warm emotionalism had not been without its
appeal, but he had no liking for tears at a crisis, nor
indeed for a crisis at all. His mind reverted to
Lucilla’s matter-of-fact fashion of dealing with the
crucial instances of life at St. Gwenllian, and theoretically,
he met her attitude with applause. But he also
remembered that he had not found her sympathetic,
upon the preceding evening.</p>

<p>Impartially, he acknowledged with a rueful smile,
his own exactingness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>He must go, and decided that it should be to London.
As for Stear, he would face it later. The
thought of Stear, and the loneliness there, brought the
realest sense of loss to him that he had yet experienced
over the defection of Valeria.</p>

<p>He had thought to hear her laughter there, to see
the apricot bloom on her lovely face, her children
growing up there.</p>

<p>With a long sigh, Owen let the vision go. The
warm, human things of life had come very near to
him, but he had not known how to hold them. Some
subtle, inner sense warned him that Valeria had done
well to betake herself and the rich gifts of her ardent
nature, to the simple and primitive life of the colonies,
and the man who was offering that life to her.</p>

<p>He went away to make his preparations for leaving
St. Gwenllian.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Valeria’s wedding, not unnaturally, provided no occasion
for festivity.</p>

<p>The bride herself remarked in private to her sisters:</p>

<p>“I feel exactly as though I was one of those unfortunate
girls who come to Father for him to marry
them so as to ‘make honest women of them’ at the
eleventh hour. You know the way that sort of wedding
is hurried through, in a hole-and-corner style....”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky for you you’ve got a good deal of your
trousseau made already,” was Lucilla’s practical reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, and ‘V. Q.’ embroidered on more than half
of it!” cried Val hysterically.</p>

<p>“You can’t possibly use it,” Flora declared austerely.
“Unless I can alter it for you in time.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Of course she can use it,” said Lucilla.</p>

<p>Valeria left them both. In the overstrained condition
of her nerves, Lucilla’s crudely-worded common-sense
and Flora’s fastidiousness were equally little to
her taste. Her father’s sorrowful gravity struck her
with despair, and Owen Quentillian’s magnanimous
detachment puzzled her sincerely, and made her doubly
remorseful.</p>

<p>It was only when George Cuscaden was actually
with her that she knew with real certainty that she
had done right at the last moment.</p>

<p>On the night before her wedding, Canon Morchard
called Valeria, gave her his blessing and forgiveness,
and handed to her some of her dead mother’s jewelry.</p>

<p>“God bless and help you in the way that you have
chosen, and may He bring all things together for good,
as He alone can do.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Father.”</p>

<p>“My child, I have nothing to forgive. It was not I
whom you wronged, but yourself,—and one other.
His pardon is yours, fully and freely, as you know
well. And now, my Valeria, you owe it to your husband
to put the past behind you. You will enter into
your new life purified by that very sense of past
error, humbled by repentance.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s voice was very gentle.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight when Valeria heard him
go upstairs.</p>

<p>George Cuscaden and Valeria were married by Mr.
Clover, immediately after Matins next day, and Canon
Morchard, throughout the ceremony, knelt with his
face hidden by his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>The sense of irrevocability that comes to most brides
assailed Valeria irresistibly for a moment as she
walked, alone with her husband, the short distance
from the church back to St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>She glanced up at him, and in the look that met hers
she found all the reassurance that she was ever to
need.</p>

<p>“A new life, and a new world, my Val. We’re
going to face things together, now.”</p>

<p>She was no longer afraid or doubtful, but felt the
strangest rush of pure exhilaration.</p>

<p>It was her justification for the past.</p>

<p>“A new life, and a new world,” she repeated.
“We’re going to be very happy, in spite of everything
that’s happened.”</p>

<p>“We <i>are</i> very happy,” said George Cuscaden firmly,
her hand held fast in his.</p>

<p>“I think they’ll forgive me, at home, in time. Father
was very kind last night, and Flossie and Lucilla have
been so good.”</p>

<p>“Val, my darling,” said the young man very seriously,
“there’s one thing I do want to say, and you mustn’t
mind. You’ve got to leave the past behind you, now.
Isn’t there something or other in the Bible about forgetting
thy father’s house and thine own people?”</p>

<p>“Something like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t really mean forgetting them, you
know. But you’ve got your own life now, and it isn’t
going to run on the old lines any more. It seems to
me there’s been such a lot of talking and thinking in
your life up to now, that there’s been no room for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
doing anything. You and I are going to change all
that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, George,” said Valeria.</p>

<p>She had, mysteriously, become absolutely happy and
absolutely secure. Nothing mattered any more at all
except the fact that George and she had found one another
in time.</p>

<p>And she was able to surmise, not without a smile,
that she had that moment heard almost the only
Scriptural quotation from her husband of which he
was ever likely to deliver himself.</p>

<p>Quotations, collections, barren discussions, abstract
ideals, all lay behind her. In future her preoccupations
would concern the health and welfare of her husband
and perhaps his children, food and clothing and
warmth, pots and pans, and the work of her own
hands.</p>

<p>And from the depths of her heart, Valeria was
glad.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br />


<small>ADRIAN</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>(i)</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">You</span> know, I can’t help thinking you’ve been all
wrong about this business of Val’s,” Adrian said reproachfully
to his remaining sisters.</p>

<p>Lucilla seemed singularly undisturbed by the distressing
pronouncement, but Flora said anxiously:</p>

<p>“Why, Adrian?”</p>

<p>“Well, look how frightfully hard it is on the rest
of us. You know what Father is—he’ll be days and
days, if not months and months, getting over this,
and it’ll put him dead against anything of that sort
for life.”</p>

<p>“These things don’t happen twice in one family, I
hope,” said Lucilla. “Neither Flora nor I are particularly
likely to break off one engagement and enter
into another and get married and go off to Canada,
all inside a week.”</p>

<p>“You girls never think of anybody but yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of doing anything like that,
then, Adrian?”</p>

<p>Lucilla appeared mildly to be amused, and not at
all impressed by the probability of her own suggestion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“How can I think of doing anything at all when
I can’t get a decent job and only have a nominal allowance?
I know Father can’t afford more, and we’re
all in the same box—and then Val goes and marries
a chap like Cuscaden, who hasn’t a penny, when she
could have had a fellow with a decent little property
and some money of his own, besides what I suppose
he makes by writing. Why, just think what she
could have done for all of us!”</p>

<p>Lucilla laughed outright.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have made millionaires of us, if she
had married Owen.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say I blame her, from one point of
view,” Adrian conceded. “A more absolute prig than
Owen has turned into, I never wish to meet. You
know he won’t promise me the living at Stear?”</p>

<p>“The living at Stear?”</p>

<p>Flora looked at her brother in all but speechless
astonishment, and Lucilla observed that a living was
usually offered to a clergyman.</p>

<p>“And is there any reason why I shouldn’t go into
the Church?” Adrian enquired, in counter-irony.
“Goodness knows there was enough talk about it before
the war, and it would please the governor
frightfully. In fact, really, I’m thinking of him as
much as anything. He was disappointed about old
David going into the army, and he’s frightfully cut
up about Val, and he may as well get a little comfort
out of one of us. And I really don’t dislike the idea
much, especially if it means a settled income in a year
or two’s time.”</p>

<p>Lucilla got up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Talk to Mr. Clover, before you say anything to
Father,” she advised. “Flossie, I’m going to see
about Val’s class.”</p>

<p>Flora looked at Adrian with grave, unhumourous
eyes.</p>

<p>“You don’t realize what Father would feel about
your speaking of going into the priesthood in that
sort of way, Adrian. You have no faintest vocation
to the life of a clergyman.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about it? I’m the only person
who can judge of that.”</p>

<p>“It lies between you and your conscience, certainly.
But if you suppose that Father, with all his experience,
would be satisfied with any but the highest
motives——”</p>

<p>She stopped expressively.</p>

<p>“There may be different opinions as to what the
highest motives <i>are</i>,” said Adrian. “I wish this business
of Val’s hadn’t put it out of the question to ask
Owen anything.”</p>

<p>“Owen is coming to Stear in another month. I am
quite certain that he doesn’t mean to let this make any
difference, and you can ask him anything you want
to. But really and truly, Adrian, if this suggestion
wasn’t so absolutely wild, I should call it most irreverent.”</p>

<p>It was evident that Flora had uttered the most profound
condemnation of which she was capable.</p>

<p>That night she enquired of Lucilla whether it was
Adrian’s infatuation for Miss Duffle that brought to
birth his strangely sudden desire for clerical life.</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“But apart from everything else, he’s much too
young to marry. And I don’t suppose she’d look at
him.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. So we needn’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>“I feel as if Adrian was somebody quite new,
whom I’d never known before.”</p>

<p>“He’s only growing up.”</p>

<p>“Does Father really know Adrian?”</p>

<p>Lucilla shook her head.</p>

<p>Both missed Valeria, and the mournful haste with
which she had been equipped for her wedding and immediate
departure for Canada had left them with a
curious sense of having come through a great
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The Canon was more profoundly depressed than
they had ever seen him, and rarely spoke. The reduced
number of people present at every meal rendered more
significant the abysmal silences of each gathering.</p>

<p>Owen Quentillian, who had shown no marked disposition
to take an immediate departure from St.
Gwenllian, had been constrained to do so by the
Canon’s grieved air of perceiving for him no other
alternative.</p>

<p>The house bore a stricken aspect.</p>

<p>Only Adrian retained a sort of uneasy jauntiness,
that petered away into silence in the presence of his
father.</p>

<p>Canon Morchard’s presence, however, was far more
withdrawn than usual from his family circle. Always
energetic, he seemed able to find innumerable claims
upon his time, and after the daily adjustment of these,
the study door was apt to shut upon him decisively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>At dinner-time only were they certain of seeing him,
and the resultant gloom was of a nature that induced
Adrian, far more affected by it than either of his sisters
appeared to be, to invite the innocuous Mr. Clover to
dinner very soon after Valeria’s departure.</p>

<p>The curate was always ready to promote conversation,
and sincerely supposed that his efforts must be
consolatory to his hosts. His attempts took the form
habitual to him of slightly self-evident remarks upon
whatever caught his eye in his surroundings.</p>

<p>“Ha! Clover, dear man!” The Canon’s voice was
sepulchral, rather than cordial. “Sit ye down—sit ye
down.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clover made a few timid remarks to his neighbour,
Flora, and wished that it had been Lucilla. He
was always rather frightened of the silent Flora, and
showed his alarmed consciousness of her musical talent
by inquiring:</p>

<p>“And how is the piano?”</p>

<p>“What have we here, Lucilla?” said the Canon
gravely, although the dish of cutlets was of an unmistakable
nature.</p>

<p>He often made use of the phrase, and on this occasion
it bore an inflexion of disapproval that was evidently
not inspired by the cutlets themselves, but by
some inner, more profound discontent.</p>

<p>“Cutlets in a silver dish,” said Mr. Clover.</p>

<p>“Do you know that the Admastons are getting up
a theatrical show?” Adrian inquired. “Good idea,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know any of them could act,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve got friends and people. I tell you who’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
awfully good—Olga Duffle. She’s going to stay on
for the performance. As a matter of fact, they’ve
asked me to help get the thing up.”</p>

<p>Adrian’s elaborately casual tone did not prevent anyone
except Lucilla from glancing surreptitiously at the
Canon, to see how the announcement was received.</p>

<p>The Canon was frowning heavily.</p>

<p>“No one has more sympathy than myself with any
diversions for young people, but the modern craze for
amusement is carried too far. What is it that your
friends are proposing to do, Adrian?”</p>

<p>“Just get up a musical show—a sort of Pierrot entertainment.
It’ll be mostly singing and dancing, I
expect.”</p>

<p>“I presume they have a charitable object in view.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” returned Adrian, in a tone that conveyed
with sufficient accuracy to the majority of his
hearers that he had no reason for supposing anything
of the sort.</p>

<p>“The youth of today is an amazement to me,”
said the Canon impressively. “After coming through
Armageddon, the young men and young women of
the present generation seem given over to a spirit of
triviality—I can call it nothing else—that amazes me.
There is no humour, today, there is ‘ragging’ or ‘rotting.’
There is no dancing—there is ‘fox-trotting,’
and ‘jazzing.’ There is no dressing, with beauty and
dignity, for young womanhood—there is blatant indecency
and an aping of a class that I cannot even name
in this room. There is no art, no drama, no literature—there
are <i>revues</i>, and a new class of novel of which
I cannot even trust myself to speak.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>The Canon drew a long breath and Adrian murmured
sub-audibly:</p>

<p>“And fifthly, and lastly——”</p>

<p>Mr. Clover gazed at the bowl in the middle of the
table and said:</p>

<p>“Very—very—nice maidenhair,” in a rapid undertone,
and Canon Morchard resumed:</p>

<p>“I yield to no one, as you young folk here should
readily admit, in my appreciation of the lighter side of
life. I believe, indeed, that I have poked some shrewd
enough fun in my day, at those who would have us
believe that this world is a gloomy place. Rather
would I say, in the old words we all know: ‘A merry
heart goes all the way, but a sad one tires in a mile’—ah!
You children can very well vouch for the amount
of innocent amusement and recreation that has gone
on amongst us. Our Sunday walks, our collecting
crazes, our family quips in which young and old have
taken full share—with deference due, be it understood,
with deference due—our evening readings-aloud—I
think all these, if they have been an entertainment, have
also provided a certain instruction. And that is as it
should be, let me tell you, young people—as it should
be.”</p>

<p>“My father read aloud the whole of the Waverly
novels to us, when we were children,” Lucilla explained
to the curate.</p>

<p>“Nowadays, I am given to understand that children
read an illustrated supplement entitled <i>Comic Cuts</i>,”
said the Canon bitterly.</p>

<p>“Pretty Wedgwood plate,” came in an aside from
Mr. Clover.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“There is a reaction even against Tennyson, that
king of song,” thundered the Canon.</p>

<p>“Most of all against Tennyson, according to Owen
Quentillian,” said Adrian rather maliciously.</p>

<p>“Owen is tainted by the folly of the day, undoubtedly—but
I cannot but believe that a young man of
intellectual calibre such as his will learn to distinguish
the true from the false in time. Owen is ‘the child of
many prayers,’” said the Canon with a sudden softening
of his voice.</p>

<p>A moment later he sighed heavily.</p>

<p>The direction of his thoughts was only too evidently
concerned with the recent disastrous turn taken by
Quentillian’s <i>affaire de cœur</i>.</p>

<p>“What is the programme of your friends’ entertainment?”
the curate timorously inquired of Adrian.</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve not really worked out the details yet,
but I’ve been asked to go over there this afternoon and
help them settle. Of course, Miss Duffle will sing, and
she’s promised to do a step-dance, and she and I
thought of getting up a play of some kind.”</p>

<p>“You are not in a position to bind yourself to anything
of that sort, Adrian,” said the Canon hastily.
“I would have you realize that this supineness cannot
go on. You appear to forget that you have to find
some work for yourself.”</p>

<p>It was so seldom that Canon Morchard vented his
feelings upon his younger son that an appalled silence
followed his words, rendering them the more noticeable.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Clover said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Half-past eight,” in time to the chiming of the
clock on the mantelpiece, and there was another silence.</p>

<p>Adrian looked sulky, and Flora nervous. The curate
gazed across the table at Lucilla and inquired:</p>

<p>“What news from India?”</p>

<p>It was the head of the house who replied.</p>

<p>“David is strangely lax as a correspondent, Clover,
strangely lax. Flora there is favoured with a letter
more often than most of us—or should I rather say,
less seldom? And yet it costs so little to send a few
lines regularly to the loving ones at home! You young
folk little think what you are laying up for yourselves
in the years to come by neglecting tokens that may
appear trivial at the time. The unspoken kind word,
the unwritten affectionate letter—how they come back
to haunt us later on!”</p>

<p>It almost appeared that these non-existent symbols
were haunting St. Gwenllian at once, so heavily did
the shadow of David’s remissness hang over the dinner
table.</p>

<p>The Canon alternated between fits of profound and
cataclysmic silence, during which he ate nothing and
his eyes became grave and fixed in their unhappiness,
and outbursts of vehement discoursiveness, that not
infrequently took the form of rhetorical remonstrances
addressed to an audience only too willing to agree with
him.</p>

<p>The consciousness of his grief pervaded the atmosphere.
No one could be unaware of it. His children,
indeed, knew of old the successive stages of
anger, morose irritability, and heart-broken remorse,
to which mental suffering reduced their father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Mr. Clover’s ineptitudes fell upon tense pauses, and
remained unanswered.</p>

<p>Gradually the little man’s kind, anxious face showed
a faint reflection of the misery that was so plainly to
be read upon the Canon’s.</p>

<p>Flora’s face looked set in its gravity, Adrian was
frankly sulky and resentful, and Lucilla’s impassivity
was tinged with regretfulness.</p>

<p>Outside sounds struck almost with violence upon the
silence within, and Mr. Clover murmured distressfully:</p>

<p>“A motor going along the road, towards the town.”</p>

<p>“The craze for rapid transport is ruining our English
countryside,” said the Canon. “Frankly, I cannot
away with it. What profit or pleasure can there be in
whirling past unseen scenery, leaving clouds of dust
and an evil odour behind?”</p>

<p>No one attempted to defend the satisfaction to be
derived from the pastime so epitomized, and the Canon
after a moment pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>“Don’t move—do not move on any account. Clover,
you will pardon me, I know. I have a great deal of
writing to get through. I shall require no coffee, Lucilla.”</p>

<p>He went out of the room, unsmiling, and with a
slow, dejected step, his grey head a little bowed forward.</p>

<p>“How long is this going to last?” inquired Adrian,
after a moment.</p>

<p>No one attempted to misunderstand his meaning.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is that he’ll be still more unhappy
a little later on, when he realizes that his depression
has reacted on all of us,” said Flora.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“In the meantime, Adrian, I strongly advise you to
find a job and begin to work at it,” Lucilla added.</p>

<p>“Your father is very, very much depressed,” said
Mr. Clover.</p>

<p>Adrian appeared to ponder these encouraging statements,
and then he observed:</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t seem to be doing any good by staying
here, so I think the best thing I can do is to accept
the Admastons’ invitation and go over there and stay
until after this show. It’ll be much handier for rehearsals,
after all.”</p>

<p>It may be supposed that this reason, however adequate
in fact, was not put forward, unsupported, by
Lucilla, upon whom Adrian as a matter of course devolved
the task of announcing his immediate intentions
to the Canon.</p>

<p>“Let it be understood that he makes no further engagement
of the kind,” said the Canon curtly. “I
cannot interfere with his promise to these people, but
this state of affairs must end. I will speak to him
before he goes. Adrian is only a boy still, for all his
war experience.”</p>

<p>There was the indulgent note in his voice that always
crept there sooner or later when speaking of his
youngest son.</p>

<p>Adrian went to the Admastons, and St. Gwenllian
became used to the silence. Gradually the Canon resumed
his habits of reading aloud after dinner, and
of exchanging small items of general and parish news
with his family during meals.</p>

<p>He seldom mentioned Valeria, but they knew that he
had written to her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>He spoke of her again when an invitation came from
the Admastons to witness their entertainment—an invitation
which Adrian, it was evident to his sisters, cheerfully
took it for granted that his father would refuse.</p>

<p>“It is very soon—very soon, indeed—to meet our
neighbours after this unhappy affair of Valeria’s, that
I fear has been only too much talked about. But it
may be right to accept—it may be right. I cannot wish
to disappoint the dear Adrian, either, though I am out
of tune with gaieties at present. I will think over it,
Lucilla, my dear, and let you know what answer to
return.”</p>

<p>Lucilla, according to her wont, uttered no opinion,
until Flora said to her:</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better if we didn’t go to these
theatricals? Won’t Father dislike them very much?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed, I should imagine.”</p>

<p>“And do you suppose Adrian <i>wants</i> us to be there?”</p>

<p>“Probably not.”</p>

<p>They looked at one another, Lucilla with a certain
rueful humourousness, Flora with none at all.</p>

<p>“But, Lucilla, can’t you stop him?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think so.”</p>

<p>Miss Morchard was always philosophical, rather
than enterprising.</p>

<p>The Canon’s decision was communicated to his
daughters a few days later.</p>

<p>“I have pondered this matter, my daughters, trivial
though it be in itself. And it seems to me that we
should do well to accept Mrs. Admaston’s invitation.
Lucilla, you are my secretary.... And one thing more,
my daughters.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>The Canon’s glance rested upon Flora, upon whose
face a shade of dismay had fallen.</p>

<p>“One thing more. ‘<i>God loveth a cheerful giver.</i>’
Even though it costs us something, let us go with a
good grace. We owe it to Valeria, to our dear erring
one, to show that she is whole-heartedly forgiven. Yes,
I can say it now, children. I have written my full and
free forgiveness to your sister. The cloud has lifted.”</p>

<p>If so, it appeared to have done so only with a view
to descending upon other members of the Morchard
<i>ménage</i>.</p>

<p>Neither Lucilla nor Flora prepared for the Admastons’
party with any feelings save those of profound
apprehension, and Adrian, meeting them in the hall,
drew Lucilla aside in order to ask indignantly:</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have stopped Father from coming tonight?
I don’t want to be a beast, but really, it’s quite
out of his line, and he won’t enjoy himself. In fact,
he’ll probably be sick.”</p>

<p>The aspirant to the ministry was garbed as a Pierrot,
with a curiously-shaped black patch upon his cheek,
revealed as a miniature couple of dancers intertwined.</p>

<p>“Olga made it—isn’t it ripping?” said Adrian of
this masterpiece. “I can’t wait—I ought to be behind
the scenes at this minute. I came to look for some
salts or something—Olga’s most awfully nervous.
She’s simply shaking. What’s the proper thing to do
for her, Lucilla? She’s really most awfully upset.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“Stage fright, I tell you. Really good actors and
actresses always get it. I wish I could get hold of
some champagne for her.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Try standing over her with the water-jug,” Lucilla
suggested crisply, and thereby deprived herself of her
brother’s presence.</p>

<p>The Canon was always apt, at any gathering, to require
a daughter upon either side, although he knew
almost everyone in the county, and met old friends
with a great and urbane pleasure. On this occasion,
his eye roved in vain for Flora.</p>

<p>She had murmured to Lucilla: “I don’t think I can
bear it. Even Maud Admaston says they’re all going
to be very <i>silly</i>, and I know Father will loathe it. I’ll
change places later if you want me to.”</p>

<p>She had then disappeared to the very back of the
large billiard-room at one end of which a stage and
curtains had been erected.</p>

<p>Their hostess, with what Lucilla inwardly qualified
as misguided kindness, conducted the Canon to a seat
near the top of the room.</p>

<p>Lucilla resignedly took her place beside him.</p>

<p>“Capital, capital!” said the Canon genially. “But
where is my little Flora?”</p>

<p>“I think she found someone who wanted to talk to
her.”</p>

<p>“Flora is still timid—very timid. I fear that Flora
has let slip her chance of joining our little family
group. I should have enjoyed having a daughter on
either side of me, to exchange impressions.”</p>

<p>The first item on the heterogeneous programme,
however, was provocative of no very eloquent exchange
of impressions between Canon Morchard and anyone
else.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>He listened with a faint air of surprise to an opening
chorus from a row of Pierrots and Pierrettes, interspersed
with various noises from a whistle, a comb,
a pair of castanets, and a small and solid poker banged
loudly and intermittently against a tin tray.</p>

<p>At the close of it he only said:</p>

<p>“I hardly recognized our dear lad, at first. That
was he, was it not, at the end of the row, next to the
little lady with black hair?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The girl was Olga Duffle. I believe she sings
a great deal.”</p>

<p>The literal truth of her own description was borne
in upon Lucilla as the evening went on. Miss Duffle
did sing a great deal.</p>

<p>She sang a solo about the Moon, and another one
about a Coal-black Baby Rose, and a third one, very
short and modern and rather indeterminate, asking
where was now the Flow’r, that had died within an
Hour, and ending on the still more poignant enquiry,
addressed to <i>le Bon Dieu</i> Above, Where was one who
said “I love”?</p>

<p>The Canon, to this item, only asked in a puzzled
way if the end was not rather abrupt?</p>

<p>“What in my day, we should have termed an unresolved
discord,” he observed with some slight severity.</p>

<p>The sudden introduction of a quantity of toy balloons
amongst the audience did not amuse him in the
least, although he smiled, coldly and politely, as the
guests, with little screams, buffeted them lightly from
one to another.</p>

<p>Only the people on the stage, all very young, seemed
thoroughly to realize the function of the toy balloons.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>They banged them hither and thither, shrieking with
laughter when the inevitable destruction ensued, and
making each miniature explosion an excuse for calling
out the catchword of the evening—imported from a
<i>revue</i> comedian whose methods, more or less successfully
imitated by most of the young men on the stage,
appeared to consist in the making of grotesque facial
contortions:—“May—I—ask—you—politely—to—<i>absquatulate</i>?”</p>

<p>At each repetition of the phrase, the actors and actresses
were overcome with mirth.</p>

<p>The members of the audience were more divided in
their opinions. Their laughter was not immoderate,
and that of Canon Morchard was non-existent.</p>

<p>Lucilla, gazing anxiously at his severe profile, was
yet able to feel it some slight relief that at least Owen
Quentillian was not present. One such expression of
melancholy beside her was more than enough.</p>

<p>“I hope I am not what is vulgarly called ‘superior’,”
said the Canon, “but I confess that all this noise appears
to me to be little short of senseless. Surely our
faculties were given us for some better purpose than
pointless, discordant merriment? No one is more
ready than myself to concede——”</p>

<p>The upheaval of an enormous drum on to the stage
debarred Lucilla from hearing what it was that no one
was more ready than her father to concede, and she
was left, amidst ever-increasing din, to judge from his
exceedingly uncompromising expression, how much
more of the performance would elapse without causing
him to become what was vulgarly called superior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>


<h3>(ii)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucilla</span> Morchard was not naturally of a sanguine
disposition, and it must have been an optimist indeed
who would have ventured to augur that the effect of
the evening’s entertainment might be of benefit to the
Canon’s spirits.</p>

<p>From placidity he passed to tolerance, and from
tolerance to endurance. In the course of the short
play that concluded the performance, Lucilla perceived
with resigned dismay that endurance was turning
rapidly to serious vexation.</p>

<p>“Extravagant, vulgar, decadent nonsense,” was the
Canon’s verdict, and Lucilla’s critical faculty endorsed
the trenchant adjectives that he had selected, although
she was devoid of her parent’s apparently acute sense
of disgust.</p>

<p>“Olga Duffle is a good actress,” she said.</p>

<p>“One dislikes the <i>levity</i> of it all so profoundly,”
said the Canon. “I believe I am the last man in the
world to hold back from any cheerful, innocent amusement
at fit and proper times and seasons, but I cannot
but regret that Adrian, naturally gifted as he is, should
turn his talents to no better account than mere buffoonery.”</p>

<p>The part relegated to Adrian in the little play was indeed
of no exalted order, and the most subtle display
of humour conceded to him was concerned with the
sudden removal of a chair behind him and his consequent
fall on to the floor.</p>

<p>The audience laughed, with mild amusement.</p>

<p>Lucilla dared not look at her father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>A spirited speech from Olga Duffle, who had shown
no signs whatever of the stage fright that had caused
her fellow-actor so much solicitude, brought down the
curtain. Lucilla’s applause was rendered vigorous by
an impulse of extreme thankfulness.</p>

<p>She was also grateful to the Canon for the measured
clapping of the palm of one hand against the back of
the other, with which he rewarded a performance that
he had certainly found to be neither instructive nor
amusing.</p>

<p>Adrian sought no parental congratulations, when
the performers, still in theatrical costume, came down
amongst the audience, but Olga Duffle made her way
towards the Canon.</p>

<p>She looked, as usual, more attractive than any of the
prettier girls present, and spoke with her habitual childlike,
almost imperceptible, suggestion of lisping.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you think us all very silly? I’m afraid we
were, but so few people care for anything else, nowadays.”</p>

<p>Her glance and gesture eloquently numbered the
Canon in the few, though she did not extend the implication
quite so far as to include Lucilla.</p>

<p>“You are a good actress, Miss Duffle. Have you
had training?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, nothing to speak of,” said Olga modestly.
“They did offer to give me a year at the big Dramatic
Training place, free, after I’d acted in a charity matinée
a few years ago in London. They said I could
easily play juvenile lead in any theatre in London at
the end of a year, but of course that was all nonsense.
Anyway my people naturally wouldn’t hear of it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Indeed. Certainly it is a very moot point how far
the possession of a definite talent justifies embracing a
life such as that of a professional actress must needs
be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it?” said Olga.</p>

<p>Her big dark eyes were fixed on the Canon’s face,
her lips parted with the expression of absorbed interest
that lent her charm as a listener.</p>

<p>Lucilla was not surprised to see that the Canon’s
face relaxed as he looked down at the small up-gazing
figure.</p>

<p>She left them, in response to an imperious glance
directed upon her from the other end of the room.</p>

<p>“I particularly want the old man to get to know
Olga,” said Adrian with agitation. “It’d do him all
the good in the world to have some of his ideas about
the modern girl put straight, and if anyone can do it,
she can. Wasn’t it priceless of her to make straight
for him like that?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she likes to talk to a distinguished man.”</p>

<p>“My dear old thing, don’t be absurd. Why, Olga
has half London at her feet.”</p>

<p>Lucilla felt unable to make any display of enthusiasm
at the announcement, although she saw no reason
to doubt that a substratum of fact underlay Adrian’s
hyperbole.</p>

<p>“I suppose Father thought the whole show utter
tripe?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say so,” Lucilla observed drily.</p>

<p>“Well, for goodness sake get him away as soon as
Olga’s had her talk with him. The Admastons are
determined to turn the whole thing into a glorious rag,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and it’ll go on till all hours. Father would be wretched,
and besides I should have him on my mind the whole
time. I daresay I shan’t have many more opportunities
of enjoying myself, so I may as well make the
most of this,” said Adrian in a voice charged with
meaning, that Lucilla understood to be an allusion to
his recent ecclesiastical ambitions.</p>

<p>When she found herself beside her father again, he
was in conversation with a short, fat, dark man whom
he made known to his daughter with a somewhat abstracted
air.</p>

<p>“Mr. Duffle, Lucilla.”</p>

<p>She was rather amused at the ease with which Olga’s
parentage could be traced, although in her, a <i>retroussé</i>
nose replaced the wide and upturned pug of her father,
and her dark, intelligent gaze was an unmistakably
improved edition of his shrewd black eyes. From
both faces shone the same ardent, restless, and essentially
animal, vitality.</p>

<p>Mr. Duffle, however, had none of Olga’s claims to
social charms and talents. Lucilla knew him to be a
successful building contractor, who had amassed a
fortune during the war, and decided that he looked the
part.</p>

<p>“I’ll come along one morning then, Canon, and have
a little chat with you,” Mr. Duffle was declaring with
a breezy assurance that could hardly have been derived
from the Canon’s expression.</p>

<p>“You’re kept pretty hard at it, I daresay?”</p>

<p>“The man who wants me is the man I want,” quoted
the Canon, with his grave smile.</p>

<p>“Capital. I’ll blow along then, and give you a call.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
My big car is in London, but we’ve got a little Daimler
down here that does very well for country lanes. My
daughter, of course, runs her own little two-seater.
These young people, nowadays, there’s no end to what
they expect. Not that I grudge Olga anything in
reason, you understand. She’s our only one, and
naturally her mother and I think the world of her.”</p>

<p>A very simple pride beamed in his face as he spoke
of Olga, and Lucilla congratulated him upon her acting.</p>

<p>“She’s pretty good, isn’t she? I believe she could
take her place amongst professionals any day, so she
tells me. But of course we shouldn’t hear of anything
like that for her. In fact, her mother and I
look very high for our little girl, very high indeed,
I may say, after all that Nature’s done for her, and
the advantages we’ve given her as well.”</p>

<p>He laughed heartily, and then leaning confidentially
towards Lucilla he said in a semi-whisper:</p>

<p>“Whoever gets our little Olga, young lady, will be
a very lucky fellow. There’ll be a little bit of—” he
tapped his forehead knowingly “and a little bit of—”
the tap was repeated, against his coat pocket this time.
Lucilla required no very acute powers of intuition to
refer these demonstrations to her brother’s intention.</p>

<p>She wondered whether the Canon had made a similar
deduction.</p>

<p>He was silent during their long drive home, but it
was the silence of thoughtfulness rather than that of
depression. The Canon’s intimates could generally
interpret without difficulty the nature of his silences.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>On the morning following he called Lucilla into the
study.</p>

<p>“I had no word with Adrian last night,” he said
wistfully. “I saw you talking to him, my dear. Did
he tell you what day he is coming home again?”</p>

<p>“No, Father.”</p>

<p>“I confess that I am perturbed. Are these new
friends of his gentlefolk, are they church people, are
they even Christians?” said the Canon, walking up
and down. “If only the boy would be more unreserved
with me! One is so terribly anxious.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he wants to be reserved. He really
has no serious suggestion to offer, as to the future.”</p>

<p>“My poor lad! He is not sufficiently in earnest. I
have blinded myself to it long enough. His early piety
and simplicity were so beautiful that perhaps I dwelt
upon them as tokens of future growth more than I
should have done. But there was a levity of tone
about these intimates of his that displeased me greatly.
It must cease, Lucilla—this intercourse must cease.”</p>

<p>Lucilla dreaded few things more than such resolutions,
from which she knew that her father, at whatever
cost to himself or to anybody else, never swerved.</p>

<p>“The Admastons are neighbours,” she pointed out.</p>

<p>“All the more reason for Adrian to be content to
meet them in the ordinary course of events, without
treating their house as an hotel. But there is a
further attraction, Lucilla, I am convinced of it.”</p>

<p>The Canon dropped his voice to impart his piece of
penetration.</p>

<p>“That little Miss Duffle is undoubtedly attractive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
but can the boy have the incredible folly to be paying
his addresses to her?”</p>

<p>It did not seem to Lucilla that any such formal term
could possibly be applied to Adrian’s highly modern
methods of displaying his admiration for Olga, and
she informed her father so with decision.</p>

<p>“He must at all events be aware that he is in no
position to render any young lady conspicuous by his
attentions,” said the Canon. “I am displeased with
Adrian, Lucilla.”</p>

<p>Canon Morchard was not alone in his displeasure.
Two days after the theatricals, Olga Duffle’s father appeared
at St. Gwenllian, and was shown into the study.</p>

<p>The Canon greeted him, his habitual rather stately
courtesy in strong contrast to his visitor’s bluff curtness
of manner.</p>

<p>“Sit you down, my dear sir.”</p>

<p>The Canon took his own place on the revolving
chair before the writing-table, and the tips of his
fingers were lightly joined together as he bent his gaze,
benignant, and yet serious, upon the little building contractor.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a nice little old place here. Needs a
lot of seeing to, though, I daresay. I see you haven’t
the electric light.”</p>

<p>The Canon glanced round him as though he had
hardly noticed, as indeed he had not, the absence
of this modern advantage.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t cost you more than a couple of hundred
to put it in,” said Mr. Duffle negligently.</p>

<p>The Canon was not in the least interested in the
problematical expense to be thus incurred, but he replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
gently that perhaps one of these days his successor
might wish to improve St. Gwenllian, and be
in a position to do so.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Mr. Duffle. “That brings me to my
point, in a roundabout sort of way. Your young man,
Canon, has no particular inheritance to look forward
to, if I understand rightly?”</p>

<p>“My young man?”</p>

<p>“Your boy Adrian. Not even your eldest son, is
he?”</p>

<p>“Adrian is the youngest of my five children,” said
the Canon with peculiar distinctness. “I have two
sons and three daughters. May I enquire the reason
of this interest in my family?”</p>

<p>“No offense, I hope, Canon. I thought you’d have
guessed the reason fast enough—my girl Olga. Now
mind you, I know very well that boys will be boys, and
girls girls, for the matter of that. I’m not even saying
that the little monkey hasn’t led him on a bit—she
leads ’em all on, come to that! But Master Adrian
has been talking of an engagement, it seems, and that
won’t do at all, you know. So I thought you and me,
Canon——”</p>

<p>“Stop!” The Canon’s face was rigid. “Am I to
understand that your daughter has reason to complain
that my son presses undesired attentions upon her, or
causes their names to be coupled together in a manner
displeasing to her?”</p>

<p>The builder’s stare was one of honest bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Coupled together!” he repeated derisively. “Why,
the lad follows her about like a little dog. I should
think old Matthew Admaston is as easy going as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
make ’em, but even he thought it a bit thick to have
your young moon-calf, if you’ll excuse the expression,
on his doorstep morning, noon and night, while my
girl was in the house, till they had to ask him to stay,
to save the front-door bell coming off in his hand.”</p>

<p>Mr. Duffle’s humourous extravagance of imagery
awoke no response in Canon Morchard.</p>

<p>“My son’s impertinent folly shall be put a stop to
immediately,” he said, through closely compressed lips.</p>

<p>“Bless me! there’s nothing that needs a rumpus
made about it, you understand. Only when it comes
to prating about being engaged, and promising to
marry him in goodness knows how many years, and
goodness knows what on—why, then it’s time us older
folk stepped in, I think, and I’m sure you’ll agree
with me.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand that my son—without reference
to me, I may add—has asked Miss Duffle to do him
the honour of becoming his wife?”</p>

<p>Mr. Duffle stared at the Canon blankly.</p>

<p>“Ill though he seems to have behaved, you will hardly
expect me to accept, on his behalf, an entire rejection
of his suit, without reference to the young lady herself.”</p>

<p>A resounding blow from Mr. Duffle’s open palm
onto his knee startled the Canon and made him jump
in his chair.</p>

<p>“Good God!” roared the builder, causing Canon
Morchard to wince a second time, “is this talk out of
a novel? How in the name of all that’s reasonable
can the boy marry without a profession or an income?
I’ll do him the justice to say that I’ve never thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
him a fortune hunter. (He’s not got the guts for that,
if you’ll excuse me being so plain-spoken.) He’s besotted
about the girl, and not the first one either, though
I do say it myself. But my Olga is our only child, and
will get every penny I have to leave, and the fact of
the matter is that she’ll be a rich woman one of these
days, in a manner of speaking. Therefore, Canon,
you’ll understand me when I say that Olga can look
high—very high, she can look.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s countenance did, indeed, show the most
complete comprehension of the case so stated. His
face, in its stern pallor, became more cameo-like than
ever.</p>

<p>“Sir, do you accuse my son of trifling, of the unutterable
meanness of endeavouring to engage a young
lady’s affections without any reasonable prospect of
asking her in marriage like an honourable man?”</p>

<p>“Bless me, Canon, I don’t accuse the young fellow
of anything, except of being a bit of an ass,” said the
builder. “I daresay it’s been six of one and half a
dozen of the other. He’s a nice-looking boy, and all
this play-acting has thrown them together, like; but
that’s over now, and Olga comes back to London with
us next week. But I thought I’d throw you a hint,”
said Mr. Duffle delicately, “so that there’s no nonsense
about following us to town, or anything of that sort.
Her mother’s going to speak to Olga about it, too.
Bless me, it’s not the first time we’ve had to nip a
little affair of this sort in the bud. The fellows are
round our little girl like flies round a honey-pot. We
give her a loose rein, too, in a manner of speaking, but
as the wife pointed out to me last night, it only keeps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
off better chances if a girl is always seen about with
lads who don’t mean business.”</p>

<p>The Canon groaned deeply, and Mr. Duffle, fearing
himself misunderstood, hastily interposed:</p>

<p>“Don’t run away with the idea that I’ve anything
against the boy, now, Canon. I’m sure if he was only
a year or two older, in a good job, and with a little
something to look to later on, I’d be only too glad of
the connection. But as things are, I’m sure as a family
man yourself you see my point.”</p>

<p>He looked almost pleadingly at the Canon as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“You did perfectly right to come to me, Mr. Duffle;
you did perfectly right. Unspeakably painful though
this conversation has been to me, I fully recognize the
necessity for it.”</p>

<p>If Mr. Duffle still looked perplexed, he also looked
relieved.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Canon. I felt you and me would
understand one another. After all, we’ve been young
ourselves, haven’t we, and I daresay we’ve chased a
pretty pair of ankles or said more than we meant on a
moonlight night, both of us, once upon a time.”</p>

<p>So far did Canon Morchard appear to be from endorsing
this view of a joint past that his visitor added
an extenuation.</p>

<p>“Of course, before you turned parson, naturally, I
mean. I know you take your job seriously, if you’ll
excuse me passing a personal remark, and that’s not
more than’s needed nowadays. There’s no idea of
young Adrian going in for the clerical line, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“What I have heard today would be enough to convince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
me that it is out of the question,” said the Canon
bitterly. “But my son has evinced no such desire.”</p>

<p>“H’m. There was some nonsense talked amongst
the young people about a fat living at Stear being
ready for him if he chose to step into it. I daresay
there was nothing in it but a leg-pull, as they say. In
any case, my girl wouldn’t look at a country parson.
No offence to you, Canon, but it’s best to have these
things out in plain English.”</p>

<p>“Enough,” said the Canon with decision. “You may
rest assured that my son will cease this insensate persecution
of——”</p>

<p>“Excuse me interrupting, but why make a mountain
out of a molehill? There’s been no persecution or any
of that talk out of books, in the case. Why, my Olga
can’t help making eyes at a good-looking lad, and letting
him squeeze her hand every now and then.”</p>

<p>The Canon gave utterance, irrepressibly, to yet another
groan.</p>

<p>Mr. Duffle looked at him with compassion.</p>

<p>“Why make a mountain out of a molehill, as I said
before?” he repeated. “There’s been no harm done,
except maybe a little gossiping among the Admaston
lot, and if you tip the wink to your lad, and mother
and I trot Olga back to London again, we needn’t hear
any more of it. We’re old-fashioned people, and
brought up the child old-fashioned, and she’s not one
of these modern young women who can’t live at home.
I give her the best of everything, and a pretty long
rope, but she knows that as long as she’s living under
my roof and spending my money she’s got to obey me
and her mother when we <i>do</i> give an order.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>The builder’s face, momentarily dogged, relaxed
again and he laughed jovially.</p>

<p>“Though I’m not saying the little puss can’t get most
things out of us by coaxing! But we’re set on a good
marriage for her, that I tell you straight.”</p>

<p>“There is only one foundation for the sacrament of
marriage,” said the Canon sombrely, “and that is mutual
love, trust and esteem.”</p>

<p>“Quite, quite; the wife always takes that line herself.
‘When the heart is given, let the hand follow,’
she always says, and Olga knows well enough that
she’ll have a free choice, within reason. But love in
a cottage isn’t her style, and things being as they are,
there’s no reason, as I said before, why she shouldn’t
look high. She’s a sensible girl, too, and if there is
a bit of the flirt about her, she doesn’t lose her head.
I will say that for her.”</p>

<p>“I wish that I could say the same of my son,” bitterly
rejoined the Canon.</p>

<p>“Well, well, don’t be too hard on the lad. Human
nature is human nature all the world over, is what I
always say. All the parsons in Christendom can’t alter
that, if you’ll excuse the saying. It’s natural enough
your son should lose his head over a pretty girl like
my Olga,” said Miss Duffle’s parent indulgently. “All
I mean is, that it must stop there, and no nonsense
about being engaged, or anything of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Do these unhappy young people consider themselves
bound to one another, as far as you know?”</p>

<p>“Bless me, Canon, they’re not unhappy. At least,
my Olga certainly isn’t, and if your lad throws off a
few heroics, he’ll soon get over it. Why, I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
threatening to blow out my brains—as I chose to call
them—when I was no older than he is, and all for the
sake of a lady ten years older than myself, and married
and the mother of three, into the bargain!”</p>

<p>Mr. Duffle was moved to hearty laughter at this
reminiscence, although it failed signally to produce the
same exhilarating effect upon Canon Morchard.</p>

<p>Perhaps in consequence of this, his mirth died away
spasmodically, with a rather apologetic effect.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Canon, take a tip from me, if I may
suggest such a thing, and don’t take this business too
seriously. He’ll be head over ears in love with somebody
else before you can look round, and it’ll all be
to do over again.”</p>

<p>Before this luminous vista of future amatory escapades,
the builder appeared to feel that the interview
had better be brought to its conclusion, and he rose.</p>

<p>An evident desire to console and reassure his host
possessed him.</p>

<p>“Get the young fellow a job of work, if I may
advise. It’s wonderful how it steadies them down.
He’ll have no time to run after the petticoats when he’s
tied by the leg to an office, or roughing it in one of the
Colonies.”</p>

<p>“The choice of a career lies in my son’s own hands,”
said the Canon stiffly. “But you may rest assured,
Mr. Duffle, that he will be allowed no further occasion
for misusing his time and abusing other people’s hospitality
as he appears to have been doing. I am obliged
to you, painful though this conversation has been to
us both, for treating me with so much frankness in
the matter.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“Don’t mention it,” said Mr. Duffle.</p>

<p>The Canon bowed slightly and escorted his visitor
to the door.</p>

<p>The Daimler car was in waiting, but the builder
paused with one foot on the step.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you one thing, Canon,” he remarked confidentially.</p>

<p>The Canon, with extreme reluctance in his demeanour,
signified attention.</p>

<p>“If you <i>should</i> think of having that little improvement
made to the place that I suggested—you know,
the electric light put in—I can tell you the very people
to go to—Blapton &amp; Co. They’ve done a lot of work
for our firm, and they’ll do it as reasonable as you can
hope for. Don’t hesitate to mention my name.”</p>

<p>He nodded, and got into the car.</p>

<p>The Canon stood upon the front doorstep, his face
pale and furrowed, his lips compressed.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted Mr. Duffle, suddenly thrusting his
head from the window of the slowly moving car.</p>

<p>The Daimler stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. Duffle descended from it nimbly and once more
approached the Canon.</p>

<p>He looked, for the first time, heated and confused.</p>

<p>“It slipped my memory that I wanted to give you
this trifle. Perhaps you’ll see to some of those poor
fellows who are out of work through no fault of their
own, having the handling of it for the wives and kiddies.
I’ve been lucky myself, and I never like to leave
a place without what I may call some sort of thanksgiving.
Not a word, please. Ta-ta.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>The Daimler made another <i>sortie</i>, and the Canon
was left, still standing motionless on the doorstep, with
the builder’s cheque for twenty-five pounds in his hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Lucilla</span>,</p>

<p>“I think you’d better not expect me till you see me,
if that’ll be all right. I may be going up to London
for a day or two when the party breaks up here tomorrow,
as I really must see about a job of some kind.
I’m sure Father will approve of this, so mind you tell
him it’s the reason. I hope he wasn’t frightfully sick
at the way we all played the fool the night of the show,
but really it was his own fault for coming, and if he
didn’t like it, he must just do the other thing.</p>

<p>“Cheerio.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Adrian</span>.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Adrian</span>,</p>

<p>“It would be better if you could come back here
before deciding to go to London. Father is writing
to you, and you will probably see from his letter that
he particularly wants you at home. I hope you are
not in trouble, but Father is certainly upset about something,
and you will only make matters worse by going
off in a hurry. Besides, I think he would quite likely
follow you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your affectionate sister,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Lucilla Morchard</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Lucilla</span>,</p>

<p>“If you hear of me doing something <i>desperate</i>, you
may tell Father that he has only himself to thank! I
now know what he and old Duffle have been up to,
between them, and I may tell you that I do not intend
to put up with this sort of thing any longer. Father
doesn’t seem to realize that I am a <i>man</i>, and in grim
earnest over <i>some</i> things, and he and old Duffle have
now utterly scotched my chances of happiness for life,
although I daresay without realizing what they were
doing. Olga is the only girl I shall ever love, and if
I have lost her I do not care what I do or what becomes
of me, and you may tell Father so. If this is what
<i>religion</i> leads to, you can also tell him that I am utterly
off it for life. That is what they have done, by their
interference with my affairs, because I am almost sure
Olga would at least have become engaged to me, if she
had been let alone, and not bullied by her father and
mother, and threatened with <i>poverty</i> if she married
me. As you know, it needn’t have been anything of
the sort, if my plans had worked out all right, and we
could have had Stear, but I am <i>completely</i> off the
Church, in any shape or form, so that is what Father
has done, whether he knows it or not!!!</p>

<p>“You will, I suppose, be upset at this letter being
so bitter in tone, but I may say that my faith in human
nature is utterly shattered for good and all, and this
has been done by my own father!! I am coming home
on Monday and <i>not before</i>, so it’s no use father dictating
to me.</p>

“<span class="smcap">Adrian</span>.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest Adrian</span>,</p>

<p>“I don’t understand why Lucilla tells me that you
are returning home on Monday, when you know it is
my wish, distinctly expressed in my letter to you two
days ago, that you should be here on Saturday, so that
we may spend the Sunday together. Unless you have
a very valid reason for disregarding my wishes, I must
insist, for your own sake, upon your complying with
them. I do so want you to be <i>considerate</i>, quite apart
from the question of <i>dutifulness</i>—for instance, it is
quite a little thing, but you don’t say what time you
are arriving here, and yet you surely know that this
makes a difference with regard to questions of meals,
etc., in a small household such as ours. It is only want
of thought, dear lad, but do try and correct this fault.
I have so often had to reprove myself for the like
small negligences that it makes me anxious to see the
same tendency in you. This is not a lecture, my dear
boy, but only a <i>reminder</i>, from one who has had to be
both mother and father to you.</p>

<p>“I have other, and very much more serious, matters
to talk over with you when we meet, but all shall be
done in the spirit of love and confidence, I do trust,
and if I am obliged to inflict pain upon you, you must
remember that it is multiplied ten-fold upon my own
head.</p>

<p>“I shall expect a line, sent either to myself or to
Lucilla, announcing the hour of your arrival on <i>Saturday</i>.
God by you, dearest of lads, until we meet.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your devoted</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Father</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Lucilla</span>,</p>

<p>“On second thoughts, I shall come home on Saturday,
in time for dinner. Most likely I shall go straight
off to London on Monday morning, but you needn’t
say anything to Father about this. If you can, persuade
him to have up the port on Sunday night.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Adrian</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Dear lad! He is all anxiety to do right, at bottom,”
said the Canon tenderly to Lucilla, when a censored
version of this communication had been passed on to
him. “You see how readily he submits to returning on
Saturday, in order to please me.”</p>

<p>If Lucilla thought this act of submission inspired
by fear, rather than by a desire to please, she did not
say so.</p>

<p>The Canon had said nothing to her of his interview
with Mr. Duffle, and made only one remark which
might be held to refer to his visitor:</p>

<p>“We are all of us apt to set a false value on appearances,
I suspect. Aye, my daughters, in spite of his
‘forty years in the wilderness,’ it is so with your father.
Trivial vulgarities, or mere superficial coarseness, have
blinded one time and again, till some sudden, beautiful
impulse or flash of generous delicacy comes to rebuke
one. Well, well—each mistake can be used as a rung
of the ladder. Always remember that.”</p>

<p>That trivial vulgarities and superficial coarseness
were characteristics of Mr. Duffle was undeniable, but
Lucilla deduced that these had been redeemed in the
manner suggested, since the builder’s prolonged visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
to her father had left him, though grave, singularly
calm. He had, indeed, summoned Adrian to St.
Gwenllian, but his manner showed none of the peculiar
restrained suffering that was always to be discerned
when the Canon felt one of his children to be in serious
fault.</p>

<p>“It is more than time that Adrian found his vocation,”
said the Canon. “I have been to blame in allowing
him to drift, but it has been an unutterable joy to
have him with us, after these terrible war years. However,
there is no further excuse for delay. He and I
must have a long talk.”</p>

<p>Lucilla could surmise only too well the effect of a
long talk upon Adrian, if his frame of mind might be
judged correctly from his impassioned letter to her.</p>

<p>As usual, however, she said nothing.</p>

<p>The Canon’s mood of mellow forbearance continued
to wax as the day went on, and he met his favourite
son with a benign affectionateness that contrasted
strangely with Adrian’s dramatically-restrained demeanour.</p>

<p>Flora, as a rule utterly incurious, asked Lucilla what
was the matter.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know. Something to do with Olga
Duffle, I imagine. Probably Adrian has proposed to
her, or something foolish of the kind, and the Duffles
want it stopped.”</p>

<p>“Has he said anything more about his idea of taking
Orders?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said Lucilla rather grimly.</p>

<p>She preferred not to imagine the Canon’s probable
reception of an ambition thus inspired.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>The long talk projected by Canon Morchard was
impracticable on a Sunday, always his busiest day,
until evening.</p>

<p>As the Canon rose from the late, and scrupulously
cold, evening meal, he said:</p>

<p>“Daughters, you will not sit up beyond your usual
hour. Adrian, my dear—come.”</p>

<p>The door of the study shut, and Lucilla and Flora
remained in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Lucilla occupied herself with note-books and works
of reference, and Flora, in the exquisite copper-plate
handwriting that the Canon had insisted upon for all
his children, in close imitation of his own, wrote out
an abstract of her father’s sermon, as she had done
almost every Sunday evening ever since she could remember.</p>

<p>The silence was unbroken till nearly an hour later,
when Lucilla observed:</p>

<p>“Do you know, Flossie, that Father’s book is very
nearly finished? There are only two more chapters
to revise.”</p>

<p>“‘Leonidas of Alexandria,’” said Flora thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The subject of the Canon’s exhaustive researches
and patient compilations was known to the household.</p>

<p>“He’ll publish it, of course?”</p>

<p>“He hopes to. But Owen told me that there isn’t a
very great demand for that kind of work, nowadays.”</p>

<p>Flora looked inquiringly at her sister.</p>

<p>“I hope Father isn’t going to be disappointed,” she
said, half interrogatively.</p>

<p>“I’m very much afraid that he is.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>On this encouraging supposition of Miss Morchard’s,
the conversation ended.</p>

<p>In accordance with their father’s desire, both sisters
had gone upstairs before the conference in the study
came to an end.</p>

<p>There came a knock at Lucilla’s door.</p>

<p>She opened it.</p>

<p>“Come in, Adrian.”</p>

<p>“It’s all up,” said Adrian, in the eloquent idiom of
his generation, and made a melodramatic gesture of
desperation.</p>

<p>Lucilla closed the door and sat down, seeming
undisturbed by so cataclysmic an announcement of
finality.</p>

<p>“I’m off on my own, after this. Father has utterly
mucked up my entire life, as I think I told you in my
letter, and he can’t see what he has done!”</p>

<p>Lucilla wondered whether Adrian had spent two and
a half hours in endeavouring to open his parent’s eyes
to his own work of destruction.</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling me exactly what has happened?”</p>

<p>Adrian embarked upon a tone of gloomy narrative.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know whether you had any idea that
I am—was—well, frightfully hard hit by that girl
Olga. Not just thinking her pretty and clever, and all
that sort of thing, you know, though of course she
was—<i>is</i>, I mean. But simply knowing that she was
the one and only person I should ever care for. Of
course, I know now that I was mistaken in her, to a
certain extent, and I can tell you, Lucilla, that it’s very
hard on a man to be as thoroughly disillusioned as I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
been. It’s enough to shatter one’s faith in women for
life.”</p>

<p>“But what did Father do?” said Lucilla, as her
brother seemed inclined to lose himself in the contemplation
of his own future mysogyny.</p>

<p>“What did he <i>do</i>?” echoed Adrian bitterly. “He
and old Duffle had the—the audacity to meet together
and discuss my private affairs, and take upon themselves
to decide that anything between me and Olga
ought to be put an end to. I must say, I thought that
kind of thing had gone out with the Middle Ages,
when people walled up their daughters alive, and all
that kind of tosh. And how Olga, of all people, put
up with it I can’t imagine; but they seemed to have
pitched some yarn about my not being able to afford to
marry, and frightened her with the idea of my being
after her money, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“But Adrian, had you asked her to marry you?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. But I did think we might have
been engaged. Then I wouldn’t have had to put up
with seeing a lot of other fellows after her,” said
Adrian naïvely.</p>

<p>“And did you explain that to Father?” Lucilla inquired,
not without a certain dismay in picturing the
Canon’s reception of these strange ideals.</p>

<p>“More or less; but you know what he is. He always
does most of the talking himself. I can quite understand
why we were so frightened of him as kids, you
know. He seems to work himself up about things, and
then he always has such a frightfully high-faluting
point of view. We might really have been talking at
cross-purposes, half the time.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“I can quite believe it.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m not exactly afraid of him now, but
it does make it a bit difficult to say what’s in one’s
mind.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the pity of it, Adrian. He always says
that he does so wish you were more unreserved with
him. He does very much want you to say what’s in
your mind.”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t like it if I did—in fact, he probably
wouldn’t understand it.”</p>

<p>Few things could be more incontrovertible.</p>

<p>“The fact is that father has quite a wrong idea of
me. He seems to expect me to have all the notions
that <i>he</i> had, when he was a young high-brow at Oxford,
about ninety years ago. As I told him, things
have gone ahead a bit since then.”</p>

<p>Lucilla, for her consolation, reflected that few people
are capable of distinguishing accurately between
what they actually say, and what they subsequently
wish themselves to have said, when reporting a conversation.
It was highly probable that Adrian had been
a good deal less eloquent than he represented himself
to have been.</p>

<p>“You didn’t say anything, did you, about your idea
of taking Orders?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Adrian rather curtly. “I did begin something
about it, just to show that I hadn’t been the
unpractical ass he seemed to think I was, but he went
off at the deep end almost directly. I said something
about going into the Church, you see, and he didn’t
wait for me to finish, but started away about our all
being ‘in the Church’ from the day of our baptism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and so on—splitting hairs, I call it. As if everyone
didn’t know what is generally meant by going into the
Church.”</p>

<p>“Well, in this case, I really hope he didn’t know.
Flossie and I always told you that Father would be
very much shocked at your way of looking at the
priesthood.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, it’s all off now,” said Adrian gloomily.
“There wouldn’t be the slightest object in it, and besides
I’m thoroughly off religion at the moment, as I
think I told you. No, I shall go to London.”</p>

<p>Lucilla looked further inquiry.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not going after Olga; you can be quite
easy about that. In fact, I may say I don’t ever want
to set eyes on her again, after the way she’s let me
down. No, I’m going to try journalism, or something
like that. Anyhow, I mean to be a free lance for a
bit.”</p>

<p>The first note of real resolution that Lucilla had
heard there, crept into Adrian’s young voice.</p>

<p>“Father really can’t go on running the show for me
like this. It’s me that’s got to decide what to do with
my life, and I’m going to get a bit of experience on
my own. I know I had six months in France, but
that isn’t going to be the whole of my life. In fact,
Lucilla, I’ve decided, though I’m sorry in a way, to
say such a thing, that Father has got to be taught a
lesson, and it’s me that’s going to do the teaching.”</p>

<p>Iron firmness, denoted by a closely compressed
mouth and a rather defiant eye fixed glassily upon Lucilla’s,
characterized Adrian’s announcement.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Lucilla.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>They heard a heavy footfall, eloquent of weariness,
outside the door. It was followed by the sound of an
imperative tap.</p>

<p>Adrian’s face relaxed and a more normal expression
succeeded to the compelling one that had petrified his
gaze.</p>

<p>“Adrian, my son, are you there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father.”</p>

<p>“Dear lad, how thoughtless you are! Your sister
is tired, and it is already very late. Finish your talk
tomorrow, my dear ones.”</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>Then Adrian said:</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose Time <i>is</i> on the wing, as usual.
Good-night, Lucilla.”</p>

<p>He went out.</p>

<p>Lucilla heard the Canon bid him good-night, and his
voice held profound sadness, rather than the vexation
that she had feared.</p>

<p>She moved swiftly to the door.</p>

<p>“Father, I have found that reference in Origen.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s face, drawn and tired, lightened on
the instant.</p>

<p>“My indefatigable searcher after truth! Lucilla indeed
casts light into dark places—you were well named,
my daughter. That is good news indeed—good news
indeed.”</p>

<p>“Should you like me to come down again, or are
you too tired?”</p>

<p>“Nay, Lucilla, you heard me bid Adrian to his room.
Would you have me transgress my own regulations?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
That would be inconsistent indeed. We will investigate
our Origen tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“You are so near the end of it now, Father.”</p>

<p>“Aye, the work has progressed wonderfully these
last few months. And I have been wonderfully blessed
in your help, my child—my right hand! It has been a
labour of love indeed.”</p>

<p>Lucilla hoped that he would go to his room still
cheered by the thought of the book. But the Canon
lingered, to enquire sadly:</p>

<p>“You have talked with Adrian?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Dear fellow, one must make all allowance for his
disappointment of his first fancy, but there is a want
of stability—what I can only call a levity of spirit—that
distresses one beyond words. He was all submission
and deference, but there was not the spontaneous
calling of deep unto deep that one somehow looked for....
And yet Adrian is the one of you all from whom
I had hoped for the greatest unreserve, the most ideal
companionship....”</p>

<p>Lucilla knew it, had always known it, only too well.</p>

<p>Not one of his other children had been treated with
the indulgence that the Canon had always displayed
towards his youngest-born.</p>

<p>The Canon’s next words chimed in oddly with her
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have condoned too much in Adrian. It
is not a strong character—but the strongest are not
always the most lovable. He talks now of going to
London.”</p>

<p>“So he told me.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“One can only trust,” said the Canon with a heavy
sigh. “I must bid you good-night, dear daughter. It
is not right that you should be kept up in this fashion.”</p>

<p>Lucilla was left to seek what repose she might.</p>

<p>The next day at St. Gwenllian was one of constraint.</p>

<p>Adrian was silent in his father’s presence, and full
of adamantine resolution in his absence. At meal
times, the subjects to be avoided—which now included
the Admastons, their theatricals, and the Duffle family,
as well as Valeria’s marriage—seemed unduly numerous.
In the evening, the Canon made a great and evident
effort, that struck Lucilla as infinitely pathetic, to
readjust matters.</p>

<p>His show of laboured brightness could deceive no
one, but Lucilla and Mr. Clover seconded his attempts
at general conversation with determination, and Flora
was not more silent than was her wont. Adrian, manifestly
sulky at first, awoke presently to a change in the
atmosphere, and thereupon erred rather upon the side
of garrulity than on that of restraint.</p>

<p>His face darkened, however, when the Canon after
dinner suddenly said with pseudo-heartiness:</p>

<p>“I am about to call one of our old-time family councils,
young people. What say you, Adrian, to a little
friendly discussion of your future plans? Time was,
perhaps, when these things were settled rather in a
long, heart-to-heart talk between father and son; but
times change, and we must move with them—we must
move with them.”</p>

<p>It was impossible to doubt that the Canon was, or
supposed himself to be, moving with the times rather
in the hope of pleasing Adrian, than from any personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
liking for the direction in which they appeared
to be taking him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some of these wiseacres may make a helpful
suggestion as to the future. Clover, you have been
guide, philosopher and friend to us all this many a
year. And Lucilla—Lucilla is gifted with a very level
head, as I sometimes tell her—a very level head. As
for my little Flora, whose head is sometimes in the
clouds, at least those who say least see most, eh Flora?
Let us to the with-drawing-room, children.”</p>

<p>Seated in the lamp light, with Lucilla and Flora both
occupied with needlework—the Canon had long ago
decreed that no discussion need entail idle hands—Canon
Morchard looked wistfully at Adrian, leaning
against the marble mantelpiece with an air of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“What are your wishes, dear lad—your hopes, your
plans?”</p>

<p>To this singularly comprehensive enquiry, Adrian
seemed to find some difficulty in making an immediate
reply.</p>

<p>“Your father is very anxious—we’re all anxious,”
said Mr. Clover pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Why should you be?” Adrian demanded fretfully,
turning sharply towards the curate. “I’m quite old
enough to settle for myself what I’m going to do.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t settled it, Adrian,” said Lucilla
mildly.</p>

<p>“That is why we all want to help you, if possible,”
the Canon observed. “Perhaps you may remember
some words that I am very fond of, and that have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
found their way now and again into our pleasant confabulations
on life and letters in general:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There comes a tide in the affairs of men</div>
<div class="verse">That, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.</div>
</div></div>

<p>“There is, indeed, a higher Leading that I trust, and
indeed know, you would none of you disregard, but
opportunity may very often serve us as an indication—an
indication. It seems to me, dear Adrian, that some
such ‘tide’ has come in your affairs now, and it would
be pleasant indeed to feel that, taken at the flood, it
would lead on to fortune, in the best and highest sense
of the word.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Mr. Clover said:</p>

<p>“Or at least independence.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want,” said Adrian ungraciously.
“Only never having been brought up to anything special,
it’s a bit hard to know what to go in for.”</p>

<p>“You said something about journalism,” Lucilla
reminded him, aware that the word, which would certainly
be distasteful to the Canon, must be uttered
sooner or later.</p>

<p>Adrian looked at his sister, and not at his father,
as he replied:</p>

<p>“I think that’s really what I shall do.”</p>

<p>“But who is going to employ you, Adrian?” Flora
enquired with simplicity.</p>

<p>The boy frowned.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand these things. I shall just
get up one or two things, and show them to the right
people, and if they’re any good at all I shall get taken
on somewhere.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“The Press is a great force for good as, alas, for
evil, my son, but I confess that such a course would be
a disappointment to me. Have you no other ambition?”
asked the Canon wistfully.</p>

<p>“I can’t think of anything else, Father.”</p>

<p>“I thought—” breathed Flora to Lucilla.</p>

<p>Lucilla shook her head, in repudiation of Adrian’s
erstwhile schemes of clerical life, and she heard from
Flora a sigh that probably denoted relief.</p>

<p>“Then, my dearest fellow, so be it. You know that
we wish nothing but your highest good, and your
happiness here and hereafter. I will increase your
present allowance as far as I can do so without robbing
others, and that should enable you to maintain yourself
in London until you are earning enough to dispense
with it. Have you any definite starting point in your
mind?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, but I can write to a fellow I know. I say,
Father—this is very good of you.”</p>

<p>There was both surprise and genuine gratitude in
Adrian’s voice.</p>

<p>The Canon, entirely regardless of anyone else as he
always was when deeply in earnest, rose and placed
his hand on the young man’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I have no wish but your truest and highest good,
dear lad, as I said before. If I have been weak enough
to indulge in plans and fancies of my own, they shall
not come between us now. I believe I may say that
I have learnt at last that whatever <i>is</i>, is best. Let us
go on, believing all things, hoping all things.... If
there has been weakness in the past, dear Adrian, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
<i>know</i> that you will justify my confidence in the future,
God helping you.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s voice had grown husky over the last
few words. He bent his head and gently and solemnly
kissed Adrian’s forehead.</p>

<p>Then he went out of the room.</p>


<h3>(iv)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> many months after Adrian’s departure, the monotonous
round of life at St. Gwenllian remained
undisturbed.</p>

<p>News came from Canada of the birth of a son to
Valeria, and the Canon’s last resentment vanished, although
he still spoke of “our poor Valeria.”</p>

<p>He derived unmistakable satisfaction from Owen
Quentillian’s presence at Stear, and the young man
received frequent invitations to the Vicarage, after a
first visit during which the host suffered infinitely more
than the guest, in the fear of reviving past associations.</p>

<p>Adrian wrote occasionally, giving no very encouraging
accounts of his progress in journalism, and continued
to receive the increased allowance that his father
sent him with scrupulous regularity. He did not come
home again, even in the summer.</p>

<p>Then one day the Canon, at his writing-table, laid
down his pen and said to Lucilla:</p>

<p>“<i>Nunc dimittis</i>.... My book is done, Lucilla;
I can add no more to it. It has been a long task, and
at times a heavy one, for the flesh is weak—for all that
the spirit is willing, the flesh is weak. But it is over
now.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>His rapt, smiling gaze held Lucilla’s for a long
while, as she smiled back her congratulation.</p>

<p>“And now, my dear one, to give our work to the
world!” He rubbed his hands together exultantly.
“For it is yours, Lucilla, almost as much as mine.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, still smiling. The Canon’s
generosity, any more than his occasional injustice, did
not blind his daughter to the bald facts of a case as
she saw it.</p>

<p>A shadow was across her genuine participation in
his joy, now.</p>

<p>“What shall you do with it, Father?”</p>

<p>“There is no more to be done,” repeated the Canon.
“All is copied, all is corrected. Your typescript is
admirable, Lucilla, and I trust that my few emendations
have not defaced it.”</p>

<p>“Then is it going to the publishers?”</p>

<p>“My practical Lucilla! Is your mind already in
search of an adequate supply of brown paper and sealing
wax? These things are not done so hastily as
impetuous youth would wish, however. There will be
a preliminary correspondence, my dear, even when I
have definitely decided which of the publishing houses
to approach. A work such as this one, which has taken
years of labour, is not sent lightly forth to take its
chance, as might be a work of fiction.”</p>

<p>The Canon laid his hand lovingly upon the immense
pile of typescript before him. It represented, as he
had said, the labour of years.</p>

<p>“Owen is in touch with several publishers, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Possibly so, Lucilla.” The Canon’s tone was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
altogether pleased. “But such a work—on such a subject—requires
no casual introduction.”</p>

<p>Lucilla wondered, not without foreboding, what it
did require. Owen Quentillian, who shared her own
inability to take optimistic views on principle, had
spoken discouragingly of the modern market for such
works as the Canon’s on “Leonidas of Alexandria.”</p>

<p>The Canon himself appeared to entertain no misgivings,
until a few weeks later, when he handed a
letter silently to Lucilla.</p>

<p>It was a courteously worded assurance from the
most eminent of theological publishing firms that the
probable sales of such a work as “Leonidas of Alexandria”
would not, in their opinion, justify the expenses
of publication.</p>

<p>The Canon seemed more bewildered than dismayed.</p>

<p>“I shall approach the Oxbridge Press,” he declared.
“I had decided against them, but this very unexpected
attitude leaves me no alternative.”</p>

<p>The reply of the Oxbridge Press, although longer
delayed, was almost identical in substance with that
of its predecessors.</p>

<p>“I do not understand it,” the Canon repeated, and
wrote to another publishing house.</p>

<p>He still spoke as though the ultimate appearance of
the book were a certainty; even when confronted with
a third refusal, but he allowed Lucilla to consult Owen
Quentillian.</p>

<p>As the result of a letter to Quentillian’s own publishers,
an offer came from them to produce “Leonidas
of Alexandria” if the author would advance a substantial
sum towards the cost of bringing out the book.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“It’s more than I dared to hope for,” Owen told
Lucilla candidly, in private. “Only I’m afraid he’ll
still be disappointed, if the book appears and makes no
stir.”</p>

<p>“He has thought of it for so many years,” said
Lucilla.</p>

<p>“And always as a <i>magnum opus</i>—something that
the world would recognize?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. But even so, I’m not certain
whether he’ll accept these terms.”</p>

<p>“He won’t get better ones,” said Owen with conviction.</p>

<p>They awaited the Canon’s reply. It came, calm and
very decided.</p>

<p>“It cannot be. It is not within my power to accept
the terms suggested. Thank you, Owen, my dear—and
you Lucilla—but my work must await better days—better
days.”</p>

<p>For the first time, Owen was struck by the singular
sweetness of the Canon’s smile, as he stood with his
hand resting on the great bulk of papers that stood
to him for the loving preoccupation of many years.
No faintest touch of bitterness accompanied his deep
disappointment.</p>

<p>“I have had the great pleasure of the work, and
it has brought me into close association with many
writers, both living and dead. We have derived
great benefit from our toil, Lucilla, and if the fruits
of reward are to be denied us yet awhile, so be it.
You remember the old story of the dying man who
bade his sons dig for a treasure beneath the apple-tree.
They did so, and the natural yield of the fertile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
earth was their reward—their own industry proved to
be their treasure. If it is to be so with my book, I am
content.”</p>

<p>Quentillian’s stern sense of the futility of false hopes
kept him silent, but Lucilla said:</p>

<p>“Is it any use to try another publisher?”</p>

<p>The Canon shook his grey head.</p>

<p>“This is neither our first attempt nor our second.
No doubt times have changed, and there is no longer
the same interest taken in these researches. The wheel
will come round in due course, young people, and I
make no doubt that Leonidas will yet be given to the
world, in God’s good time whether in my day or not.
I am very well content.”</p>

<p>He put the heavy package into a drawer, of which
he turned the key.</p>

<p>“You remember, Lucilla, the words inscribed upon
my front page—‘<i>Ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>’? Surely
we can trust the fulfilment of those words to Him,
and as surely He can justify them in obscurity as in
the notoriety of a day. We will say no more about
this, children.”</p>

<p>He turned towards Quentillian, and smiled again.</p>

<p>“Nay, dear fellow, there is nothing to look so blank
about. I will not deny a natural disappointment, but it
is no more than that—no more than that. These
things pass....”</p>

<p>Even to Lucilla, in private, the Canon scarcely said
more. The one revelation that he did make, hardly
surprised her.</p>

<p>“All else apart, I could not have paid the money to
that publishing firm. The dear Adrian must be my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
first consideration at present, and with the increased
amount that he is receiving, the drain upon my purse
is too heavy to admit of a personal gratification. Some
day the dear fellow will pay it all back, I make no
doubt, though even were it not so—but it <i>will</i> be so.
And now, Lucilla, we will drop the subject. What I
have told you is between ourselves, and we need not
refer to it again.”</p>

<p>A very little while later, the Canon began to make
minute and elaborate notes for a Commentary on the
Epistle to the Philippians.</p>

<p>Lucilla, according to her wont, acted as his secretary
without comment.</p>

<p>It was more difficult, however, to pursue this course
when the Canon, with a look of distress and perplexity,
handed to her several closely-written sheets of paper,
and observed:</p>

<p>“As you know, I hold very strongly to the sacredness
of personal correspondence. It was, indeed, at
least partly on that account that I have said nothing
to you of a letter from Adrian that has caused me some
anxiety. He seems to me to be getting amongst a set
of people whom I can only call undesirable. They
may be leading him into foolish extravagance—I fear
it must be so. It seems to me my clear duty to write
to the boy very frankly, but God knows how carefully
I have weighed every word, for fear of saying too
much. I believe I am justified in letting you read it.
A sister’s influence can do much, more especially when
she has been obliged to enact the part of mother, and it
may even be that Adrian will listen to you more readily
than to me.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>The Canon sighed heavily.</p>

<p>Although his sudden, sharp outbursts of anger had,
at one time or another, included each and every one of
his children, his tolerance was always longest where
Adrian was concerned. So, too, was his profound distress
when the shortcomings of his youngest-born
were made only too manifest.</p>

<p>Lucilla read the letter with considerable inward disquiet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest Adrian</span>,</p>

<p>“First and foremost, I enclose a cheque, with which
you must <i>at once</i> discharge outstanding liabilities. You
must not, however, take this as an easy method of getting
out of difficulties into which you have placed
yourself. I shall stop this money out of your allowance,
in justice both to yourself and to me, in quarterly
instalments. And now, my son, you must bear
with me while I write of several things that seem to
me to be much amiss in your present way of life. Your
letters are so far from explicit (how I wish it were
otherwise!) that one can only guess at much which
is left unsaid, but your request for money, however
veiled, is an admission in itself. You write of ‘others,’
but can you not see that it is absolute <i>dishonesty</i> to
give presents, stand host at various small outings, and
the like, when this implies the spending of money
that I give you for one purpose, on quite another?
No one knows better than myself the pleasure to be derived
from such little attentions to those whose kindness
calls for recognition, or to whom we feel drawn
by sympathy, and before whom we perhaps like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
pose in the light of a benefactor. Such gratifications
are harmless, and may even be beneficial, in themselves,
but they are at present amongst the things
which you <i>must</i> learn to deny yourself. How I wish
I could <i>say</i> this, instead of writing it! Could you not
come to us for a few days, and we would thrash all
these matters out together as one can only do in a long,
tête-à-tête evening talk over the fire, or perhaps a ten-mile
tramp far out into the country. Let me know
what hope there is of your getting down here, and
when.</p>

<p>“In regard to the question of returning hospitality, it
does seem to me a most moot point how far such obligations
should bind us. Certainly they should not do
so <i>if entailing interference with work or prayer</i>. You
say nothing on these points, so do consider this question
next time you write. It is so disappointing to receive
short notes, written in haste, telling one nothing
of yourself, and with questions in home letters left unanswered.
<i>Do</i> write more fully of yourself—I am so
much disturbed about you, and cannot understand why
you should say that you have ‘nothing to write about.’
<i>All</i> is of the deepest interest to those who love you so,
and you tell us so little! You give no account of your
Sundays, spiritual experiences, private readings and the
like, but if this does not come spontaneously, it is of
no use to try and force it.</p>

<p>“I should like to hear something, however, of your
friends. With whom do you work, spend your Sundays,
evening leisure hours, etc.? All these details
would be of the greatest interest, and, although one has
no wish to press on that particular aspect of the case,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
they are points upon which your father has every right
to information.</p>

<p>“Why did you not tell me of your little sketch in
the <i>Athene</i>? Owen Quentillian brought it to my
notice, supposing me, naturally, to be aware of its
authorship. It seemed to me to be well and brightly
written, though perhaps a little trivial in conception,
but you have a slip in the first paragraph, line 4, where
you make ‘etomology’ do duty for ‘<i>en</i>tomology.’ If
this is a printer’s error, and you did not correct the
proofs yourself, draw your editor’s attention to it <i>at
once</i>. The final quotation from de Musset, is, I <i>think</i>,
incorrect, but I am not sure of this, and cannot verify
at present. He is not a writer about whom I care. Do
you read much of him?”</p>
</div>

<p>At this point Lucilla laid down the letter and said
emphatically:</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t. Read de Musset, I mean. Probably
he got the verse he quotes out of a book of quotations.”</p>

<p>The Canon looked surprised.</p>

<p>“I am aware that modern methods are slip-shod, but
Adrian’s knowledge of French is much above the
average. Our evening readings-aloud have seen to
that.”</p>

<p>Lucilla picked up the sheets of paper again, wondering
if there was very much more of the letter to come—a
wonder not infrequently felt by those with whom
Canon Morchard was in correspondence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Do eschew the use of slang <i>absolutely</i>, at least in
writing! I quite consider that ‘stunt’ comes under this
heading, in your article. It is an Americanism, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
ugly! These criticisms, if such they be, are only the
outcome, need I tell you, of my really intense desire
that you should do full justice to yourself, and to the
talent that I feel sure is in you. And let me repeat
again, my dearest lad, that this applies <i>doubly</i> to the
more serious fault-finding that I have been obliged, as
your father, to put into this letter. You must write to
me fully and freely if it seems to you that anything
which I have said is unjust, but I believe that your
own conscience, and the candour that I know is yours,
will endorse all that I have written. In that case, you
will know well where to seek for the <i>unfailing</i> strength
necessary to a fresh beginning and a full confession of
error.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you with what anxiety I shall await
your answer, and do make it a really open-hearted one,
as I well know that you <i>can</i>. There shall be no cloud
upon our meeting when we do meet, once things have
been made clear between us by letter, but I do feel that
for your own sake, far more than for mine, this
strange reticence on your part must not continue.</p>

<p>“Look upon me as your best earthly friend, dear lad,
as well as your father, for no one can be more eager
to sympathize with you on every point than I am—and
have always been. It has always seemed to me
that the relationship of father and son could—and
should—be an utterly <i>ideal</i> one.</p>

<p>“My love to you, as always, and do write <i>at once</i>.
I must not end this without reminding you that business-like
habits, which I am so anxious that you should
acquire, make it <i>obligatory</i> to acknowledge a cheque by
return of post, even were there not other reasons for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
writing without delay. Anything that you wish treated
as confidential will of course be sacred—but that you
know already.</p>

<p>“In all lovingness, dear Adrian, I remain your most
devoted father,</p>

<p class="right">“F. L. M.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Can I say more?” the Canon enquired sadly and
anxiously, as Lucilla laid down the letter. To which
Lucilla, with restraint, replied by a bald negative.</p>

<p>“I have weighed every word,” her father repeated,
with, as she knew, only too much truth.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Adrian may feel that you are taking him
too seriously altogether. He sometimes seems——”</p>

<p>“Whom, and what, should I take seriously if not my
son, and his earthly and eternal welfare?” the Canon
interrupted her rather sternly. “You take a great deal
upon yourself, Lucilla, in speaking so. No doubt you
say to yourself: ‘I am young, I am of the period, it
is for me to act as interpreter between the parent, who
is of another generation, and the youth, who belongs
to mine.’ But if I read your thought correctly, my
child—and I have no doubt that I do—it is an arrogant
one, and altogether unworthy of you.”</p>

<p>Lucilla did not explain that no such determination
had crossed her mind as the self-sufficient one ascribed
to her. She was aware, in common with all the
Canon’s children, that he was prone to attribute to
them occasionally motives and attitudes of mind
strangely and almost incredibly alien to anything to
which they could ever reasonably lay claim. Far more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
often, did he credit them with aspirations and intentions
of a quite undeserved sublimity.</p>

<p>Her inward fear, that Adrian would probably leave
the major part of his father’s letter unread, she did
not put into words.</p>

<p>“Owen tells me that he is shortly going to London,
and I shall make a point of asking him to see our dear
fellow and bring me a full report,” said the Canon.</p>

<p>He proffered his request shortly afterwards to
Quentillian, by whom it was received with no enthusiasm
whatever.</p>

<p>“Will Adrian like it?” he enquired, although fully
conscious that Adrian would not.</p>

<p>“Aye, that he will,” said the Canon with emphasis.
“It is just because we feel you to be so thoroughly
one of ourselves, dear Owen, that I am asking you to
act the elder brother’s part that would be David’s, were
he at home.”</p>

<p>Lucilla could sympathize in the entire absence of
elation with which Quentillian took his departure,
under the new honour thus thrust upon him.</p>

<p>There was a certain rueful amusement under his
discomfiture when he left St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>On his return, Lucilla discovered instantly that any
lurking amusement had been stifled under a perfectly
real anxiety.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she almost involuntarily asked, as she
mechanically made her preparations at the tea-table for
the Canon’s entrance.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I have news that will distress you all,
about Adrian.”</p>

<p>“Is he ill?” said Flora.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“No. I’m sorry if I frightened you. He has taken
up some work that I’m afraid the Canon will disapprove
of—on the staff of Hale’s paper.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” Flora asked, with grave, innocent
eyes.</p>

<p>But Lucilla said at once: “That’s the new review
that has been so very much criticized for its attitude
towards the Church, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Flora caught her breath, and her delicate
face expressed the violent and instinctive recoil of her
spirit.</p>

<p>Owen looked at Lucilla.</p>

<p>Her indignation took a line that was not altogether
what he had expected.</p>

<p>“Well, surely Adrian need not have found a way
of asserting his independence that must run counter to
everything Father has ever taught!”</p>

<p>“He isn’t exactly doing it out of the spirit of opposition.
Hale has taken a fancy to him, and it’s the
first chance Adrian has had of regular, paid work.
From a worldly point of view, he’d be a fool not to
have accepted it.”</p>

<p>“A worldly point of view!” echoed Flora. “One
doesn’t expect that in Father’s son, somehow.”</p>

<p>Theoretically, Quentillian felt, one didn’t.</p>

<p>“Surely Adrian isn’t capable of controversial writing?”
Flora added, with a severity that saw apparently
nothing humourous in the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Nothing of that sort will be required of him. He
will only write light articles, like that thing you saw in
the <i>Athene</i>. The point is that he is working for a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
like Hale, whose reputation—which is fairly considerable
in its own way—rests entirely upon his very anticlerical
attitude.”</p>

<p>“But how can Adrian reconcile that with his duty as
a Church member?” said Flora tersely.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask him,” was Quentillian’s equally terse
reply.</p>

<p>They all three remained silent.</p>

<p>“Is Adrian going to write to Father, or has he
written already?” Flora asked at last.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t written.”</p>

<p>Lucilla’s short-sighted gaze, with the rather intent
look characteristic of a difficulty in focussing, rested
for a moment upon Quentillian’s face. Then she asked
quietly:</p>

<p>“Did he ask you to tell Father for him?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“How like Adrian,” said Lucilla.</p>

<p>She made the statement very matter-of-factly, but
Quentillian knew it to be none the less a condemnation.</p>

<p>“There was—is—no chance of making Adrian give
it up?” Flora asked.</p>

<p>“None, I should think, at present. Hale is a man
of great personality, and Adrian is a good deal flattered,
naturally enough, at being taken up by him. Of
course he knows as well as you or I that it’s the thing
of all others to distress the Canon most. He’s genuinely
upset about it, in a way, but he struck me as being
rather childishly bent on showing that he can strike
out a line of his own.”</p>

<p>“Poor, poor Father! He has had so much to bear
lately. Must he be told?” said Flora.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Of course he must. But I don’t think Owen is the
person to do the telling. Adrian should do it himself.”</p>

<p>“So I told him,” Quentillian observed rather grimly.
“The utmost I could get out of him was a very short
note, that I am to give to the Canon when he knows
the facts.”</p>

<p>No comment followed the announcement of so slender
an achievement, and they were sitting in silence
when Canon Morchard came in.</p>

<p>He greeted Owen Quentillian affectionately, as he
always did, but said quickly:</p>

<p>“I am afraid that you bear no very glad tidings,
dear fellow. No matter. We will have our talk later.
Let us forget grave subjects, and partake of ‘the cup
that cheers,’ which I can see that Lucilla there has
ready for us. What think you of this political crisis?”</p>

<p>In the ensuing conversation the Canon, if not merry,
was at least gravely cheerful.</p>

<p>Afterwards he took Owen into the garden, his arm
laid across the young man’s shoulders in the fashion
that he so often adopted.</p>

<p>They remained out for a long while.</p>

<p>Lucilla did not see her father again until evening,
when it was evident that a weight of unhappiness had
descended upon him.</p>

<p>He read Prayers as usual, and the servants left the
room.</p>

<p>“One moment, my daughters. It is right that you
should know the very grievous news I have learnt today.
Adrian has definitely adopted a career which
must cut him off from those of us who are living
members of the Church. He has cast in his lot with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
an enemy of the Church—a man who makes his living,
and has acquired a disgraceful notoriety, by attacking
the Church. Your brother has been seduced into a
friendship with this man—he is working for him,
writing for his paper.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s voice broke.</p>

<p>“I am going up to seek him tomorrow, and plead
with him, but I have little hope. He does not answer
the letters that I write with such yearning anxiety and
love—I have lost my influence over him. If it is, as
I fear, then—‘if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off.’
My dear children, I ask you to join with me here and
now in intercession for our erring one.”</p>

<p>He broke down, and the tears ran down his face.</p>

<p>It was as though Adrian’s defection cost him a double
pang: that to his own fatherhood, and that to the
ministry of the Church which he felt to be such a
living reality.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br />


<small>DAVID AND FLORA</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>(i)</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> cannot be, my dear,” the Canon repeated. So
inexorable was his voice, in all its kindness, that his
daughter Flora felt that it could not, indeed be.</p>

<p>But it was Lucilla who had launched the “it” in
question, and it was to Lucilla that the parental negative
had been already addressed no less than three times.</p>

<p>“If I am thus patient with this strange persistence
of yours, Lucilla,” said the Canon, his voice deepening
after a fashion which indicated not at all obscurely
that he might not continue to be patient very much
longer, “if I am thus patient, it is because I do you
the justice to believe that it is sisterly affection for
our poor Valeria and her little one, and not a mere
restless desire for change, that has induced you to
put forward this astonishing proposal. But consider
the folly and selfishness of this scheme, my child. You
propose to spend money—which we can ill afford, any
of us—and sacrifice time and strength in a wild rush
overseas, an insensate dash through an unknown country,
in search of your sister’s new home. No doubt
you say to yourself ‘I am the winged Messenger of the
Gods. I fly to take help and comfort to our erring one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
I will assist this new little life that is coming into the
world.’ You picture to yourself a triumphal progress—a
rapturous welcome—the acclamations of a New
World. But you deceive yourself, Lucilla. You deceive
yourself grossly.”</p>

<p>Flora felt herself colouring as she bent over her
needlework. A display of violent emotion as that into
which Canon Morchard was now working himself by
force of his own eloquence, was always distasteful to
her, and she felt a vicarious shame for Lucilla, convicted
of such presumptuous flights of fancy.</p>

<p>Flora was astonished at the calm of her sister’s reply,
when it came.</p>

<p>“But I don’t, Father. I hadn’t any idea of doing
anything but travelling to Canada in the ordinary way,
and being with Val when her new baby arrives. You
know, it is dreadfully soon after her first one, and she
really isn’t——”</p>

<p>“Have a care, Lucilla! Who are you to question
the time and seasons appointed by the All-seeing Wisdom
for the bestowal of the infinite blessing of children?”</p>

<p>If Lucilla represented an infinite blessing to Canon
Morchard, the fact was not over evident at the moment.
His brow was thunderous as he gazed at her.</p>

<p>“It is Valeria’s own choice that has sent her into a
far country. She might have been at our very gates,
had she but willed it so.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lucilla reasonably. “I don’t think if
Val had been so near us as all that, she would have
written and begged one of us to come to her. It’s
just because she’s out there, such a long way off, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
with no one to help her, that she’s frightened. Why,
she may not even be able to get a servant.”</p>

<p>“Poor child!” The Canon’s voice softened. “The
way of transgressors is hard. But two wrongs never
yet made a right, Lucilla. I recognize the generous
impulse that moves you—if I spoke sharply just now,
it was only from my intense wish to see you do justice
to your own <i>really</i> noble character, my child. Believe
me, your duty lies here, in the state to which it has
pleased God to call you.”</p>

<p>Lucilla’s brows contracted slightly, after her short-sighted
fashion, but it was not at all with an effect
of vexation, but rather of some slight perplexity.</p>

<p>At last she said:</p>

<p>“Could Flora go?”</p>

<p>Flora, startled, looked at her father. For a moment
it occurred to her that perhaps he would be willing
to spare her. Her heart leapt at the thought of seeing
Val, and Val’s babies. A vista of new experiences, of
hitherto undreamed-of independence, startled even
whilst it pleasantly excited her.</p>

<p>Then her father said: “My dear, of what are you
thinking? Your zealous desire to befriend one sister
makes you strangely inconsiderate of the other. Flora
is neither accustomed to responsibility, nor is she very
robust in health. Certainly, were it a clear question
of duty, one could put all that aside—but the call would
have to be unmistakable, the leading beyond all question.
I can see no such indications here.”</p>

<p>Flora, quietly bent over her needlework once more,
was ashamed of the realization that she was disappointed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Inwardly, she offered instant expiation for the rebellious
moment, consciously addressing herself to the
personal Divinity by whom, she had always been taught,
every hair of her head was numbered.</p>

<p>The reflection came, in immediate consolation, that
she was not without her spiritual glory, by this very
act of resignation.</p>

<p>“They also serve who only stand and wait,” she
thought.</p>

<p>The Canon had often quoted this to Flora, and indeed
to any of his children who showed a desire for
alien activities.</p>

<p>Flora might be said to have stood and waited for
some time now. It occurred to her that if Lucilla
went to Canada, responsibilities at home, other than
passive ones, would become her own portion. The
thought did not displease her. Flora, too, though far
less consciously than Valeria, had sometimes glimpsed
the sterility of her days.</p>

<p>“Lucilla, you know where to seek counsel, I believe,”
said Canon Morchard gravely. “I make all due allowance
for your natural, loving impulse towards our poor
Valeria—all due allowance. If your heart bleeds for
her, how much more does not mine? But there are
times when we must do violence to our natural feelings
and I believe that some such necessity is upon you
now. Deny yourself, my daughter, and He will bless
the sacrifice both to you and to our dear one far
away.”</p>

<p>“But who will look after her when her baby is
born?” said Lucilla reflectively.</p>

<p>“Lucilla, where is your trust?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Mostly in myself, I think,” said Lucilla gently.
“I really shouldn’t feel it right not to go to Val, Father.
I hope you will forgive me.” She spoke so gently,
with so simple a note of sincere regret in her quiet
voice, that the Canon, to Flora’s perceptions, appeared
to overlook the slightly blasphemous implication in the
first words of her sentence.</p>

<p>“No man is more averse than myself from tampering
with another’s conscience,” he said, with gravity
and displeasure. “You are no longer a child, Lucilla,
but have a care lest self-will should blind you. I have
long since warned you of the danger of self-complacency.
I lay no commands upon you, but I do most
earnestly beg, my child, that you will submit your own
judgment to a higher Tribunal than any earthly one,
before coming to any decision. Commune with your
own heart, Lucilla, and be sure that self-seeking is
not lurking under the guise of loving-kindness.”</p>

<p>The Canon went out of the room and Flora and
Lucilla were left together.</p>

<p>It was evident that Lucilla saw no urgent necessity
for complying with her father’s advice and communing
with her own heart. She sat down at her writing-table,
wrote for a few moments, and read over what she had
written. Then she handed the half-sheet of notepaper
to Flora.</p>

<p>It bore the announcement that a lady wishing shortly
to travel to Canada, would give her services on the
journey in return for part passage.</p>

<p>“But you mean to go, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought Father advised you to think it over?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“I did think it over. Didn’t you hear me say just
now that I should think it wrong <i>not</i> to go to Val?”</p>

<p>“You are setting your own judgment up above
Father’s,” Flora pointed out coldly.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Lucilla assented, seeming rather
surprised, as though such an aspect of the case had not
hitherto presented itself to her.</p>

<p>Flora softened.</p>

<p>“I can’t help being glad you’re going to be with poor
Val when she wants you. And oh, Lucilla! You’ll
see little Georgie!”</p>

<p>“I know. I wish you could, too.”</p>

<p>“So do I.” She suddenly caught her breath. “Not
that I should do what you’re doing, for a moment.
I don’t see how you <i>can</i>, in direct opposition to Father’s
advice.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you see it like that,” said Lucilla gently.
“Now, Flora, as I may have to take my passage when I
can get it, without much notice, I’d like to arrange one
or two things with you. Would you like me to give
Ethel a month’s notice? She’s a bad housemaid, but if
you’d rather she stayed on till——”</p>

<p>“Lucilla, you talk as though it were all settled!”</p>

<p>“My dear, it <i>is</i> all settled. I told you that my mind
was made up.”</p>

<p>“You know that Father will miss you most terribly?
And, though he never speaks about it, he still grieves
dreadfully over Adrian.”</p>

<p>“I know. That hasn’t really got anything to do with
it, though, has it? If you keep on Ethel, you will have
to make certain that she——”</p>

<p>“I can’t talk about Ethel now, Lucilla. I’ll do the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
best I can, if you really do go. Don’t think I’m unkind,
please. I do understand that it must be a great
temptation, after poor Val’s letter saying how much
she wants you. I daresay if she’d written like that to
me,” said Flora with an effort, “that I might have felt
it dreadfully difficult to refuse to go to her.”</p>

<p>Lucilla paused on her way to the door, and looked at
her sister with friendly, reflective interest.</p>

<p>“But you would have refused?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it always safest,” said Flora diffidently, and
yet with the implacable certainty of rightness, too,
“isn’t it always safest, when there’s a choice—or what
looks like a choice—to do whatever one likes least?”</p>

<p>“Lucilla!” called the Canon’s voice.</p>

<p>She opened the door.</p>

<p>“No, I shouldn’t call that a very good rule, myself.
You’ll let me know about Ethel as soon as you can,
won’t you? Her month’s trial will be up next Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“<i>Lucilla!</i>”</p>

<p>“I’m coming, Father.”</p>

<p>She went.</p>

<p>Flora let her work drop into her lap and folded her
hands, allowing her thoughts to wander.</p>

<p>Could it be right to feel that the wrong-doing of
another might prove to be one’s own opportunity, come
at last? She felt herself to have striven for so long
with the endeavour to prove faithful in that which was
least, all the time stifling resentment that no greater,
more heroic task should be set her. She had always
felt herself to be “little Flora” to her father, a child, to
be petted and sheltered, and in the minute introspection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of a nightly examination of conscience, she had
frequently to reproach herself bitterly for an ungrateful
longing to emerge sometimes from the shielded
into the shielding. If Lucilla went away, their father
would be alone, deserted except for Flora. David was
in India. He wrote very seldom, and then never of
coming home. Even his letters to Flora herself, always
his favourite sister, were neither confidential nor
frequent. Val was married, in Canada, and was claiming
Lucilla’s presence almost as a right. Adrian, in
London, was the subject of daily intercession at St.
Gwenllian but it was known to all his children that
the Canon would not again receive Adrian at home
until he should have severed all connection with the
atheist, Hale.</p>

<p>How they had failed their father, all of them!
Flora resolved passionately that she herself would
never fail him. Prayer was the form of self-expression
most natural to her, and she made ardent inward
supplication that if Lucilla were permitted to follow
her own way, good might come of it, and she herself
prove worthy of her sacred filial charge. No such
exaltation of spirit could be indulged in when Lucilla’s
decision had been openly accepted, and her preparations
begun.</p>

<p>She preserved all her usual even cheerfulness, and
her conversation was rather more severely practical
than before.</p>

<p>“Don’t let the key of the storeroom out of your own
possession, Flossie, please. I’m sure both the maids
are trustworthy, but it’s no use breaking rules.”</p>

<p>And:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Remember <i>not</i> to order anything eggy when Mr.
Clover comes to a meal. He can’t eat eggs.”</p>

<p>“I mean to do my very best for everyone while
you’re away. But of course it won’t be the same for
Father.”</p>

<p>“I expect it will, if you’re careful,” said Lucilla
kindly. “Don’t let her put flavourings into everything,
though—he can’t bear them.”</p>

<p>She seemed not at all preoccupied with less material
considerations.</p>

<p>Even at the last, she bade them good-bye without
any of that aspect of remorse which Flora privately
considered that she ought to have worn.</p>

<p>The Canon was very kind and forbearing, and said
at the last moment:</p>

<p>“I hope and believe that you children understand
what is meant by large-mindedness, and that I myself
am the last man in the world to deny to each individual
the right of an independent judgment. You are acting
according to your lights, Lucilla, and I am willing—nay,
eager—to believe in the sincerity of your
motives. God bless you, my dearest one, and prosper
your mission.”</p>

<p>Lucilla’s farewell was affectionate, but not at all
emotional, Flora was always undemonstrative by instinct,
and it was only the Canon whose eyes were
moist, and whose voice shook.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he turned to his remaining child after
a moment and spoke very firmly.</p>

<p>“You may wonder, little Flora, that I have no reproach
for Lucilla. She is leaving home against my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
advice, against my wishes. I believe that she deceives
herself. But Lucilla means well—she means well. As
we go through life, we learn to be very tolerant, very
patient, to understand better what is meant by forgiveness
‘unto seventy times seven’.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her.</p>

<p>“You and I must have some pleasant tête-à-tête
evenings, Flora, now that we are left to bear one another
company. I should like to rub up some of my
old Italian lore. Shall we undertake some such task
as Dante’s <i>Paradiso</i> for our leisure time?”</p>

<p>Flora assented, gratified.</p>

<p>Their days fell into a routine that suited her well,
and although in her daily and nightly prayers Flora
mentioned the names of both Adrian and Lucilla as
candidates for Divine Mercy, she was not really conscious
of any very earnest personal wish for the return
of either to St. Gwenllian.</p>


<h3>(ii)</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">On</span> the 18th November, suddenly, at Bombay,
David, beloved elder son of Canon Morchard of St.
Gwenllian Vicarage....”</p>

<p>Owen Quentillian was away from Stear when he
read the announcement, with a strong sense of shock.</p>

<p>Why should David Morchard die?</p>

<p>He wrote to the Canon, and also, after a little hesitation,
to Flora Morchard.</p>

<p>As he half expected, Flora’s reply told him more
than the Canon’s numerous pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Owen</span>:</p>

<p>“Thank you for your letter. We knew that you would
be sorry, and would understand what this must be to
my father, and all of us. He is so brave and good, and
everyone is kindness itself. We do not know anything
at all except the bare fact, which was cabled from
the Regimental headquarters, and it will probably be
another three weeks before letters can reach us. If
you like, I will write again when they do. We shall
want to see you very much when you get back to Stear.
Father speaks of you so often, as though it would be
a comfort to him to see you again.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours sincerely,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Flora Morchard</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Canon’s minute legible handwriting covered several
pages, and he, like Flora, but at far greater length,
emphasized the kindness shown to him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My people here have shown feeling such as I
dare hardly dwell upon, lest I overset altogether such
composure as I may have won. Some of them, of
course, remember our dear, dear fellow well, young
though he was when he left us. But even those who
never knew him speak such words as well-nigh break
one’s heart with gratitude and pity and tenderness. I
tell myself that whatever is, must be best, and yet,
Owen, the longing, that I can only trust may not be
repining, to have had but one day—one hour—together,
before this blow fell! It was so long since we had
spoken together! And sometimes I reproached him for
his long silences, for the absence of the details that one
longed for, in his letters home. How could I, ah, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
could I, I now ask myself sadly, who will receive
no more letters from him again. How one learns to
be gentle, as the years go on, but the day comes when
each unloving word, each selfish thought, comes back
to break one’s heart! And yet, Owen, who could have
thought that <i>I</i> should be left, who have seen nigh on
three-score years, and that strong, gallant lad taken in
the very strength of his manhood. Truly, God’s ways
are not our ways.</p>

<p>“It does not bear writing of. We must have many
long talks together, when you are with us again. What
a contrast to that first visit of yours, Owen, when our
numbers were yet unbroken, save indeed that first,
great gap that only Lucilla and the dear lad who is
gone, could realize. At least, their mother has one
with her!</p>

<p>“When you first came to us after the war, it was to
give us direct news of our beloved boy. I seem to remember
some merry gatherings then, with Lucilla and
Flora ‘making musik,’ and Valeria all fun and brightness—I
can write of her freely, dear Owen, can I not—the
old wound is healed now?—and Adrian still the
veriest boy, the light and sunshine of the house.</p>

<p>“You will find change and stillness and emptiness
about the old place, now. All are scattered, only Flora
left in the empty nest. I can find no words to tell you
what she has been, Owen. Friend, companion, daughter,
comforter! Of all my children, Flora and Lucilla
are the two who have never failed me, never failed
their own higher selves. And Lucilla, as you know,
is away from us at present. Poor child! What a
punishment for her self-will in leaving us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Flora and poor Clover have spared me in every
possible way these days, and whilst I have them, I can
indeed never think myself wholly desolate. Letters will
not reach us yet awhile from India, and one longs, and
yet dreads, to receive them. There may be one from
our poor lad himself—yet why do I call him ‘poor,’
when he is so far more blest than we who are left? We
can only conjecture that cholera or fever struck him
down, he said nothing of sickness in his last letter, and
whatever it was must have come upon him with fearful
suddenness. One can only hope and pray that the Infinite
Mercy allowed him time to meet the dread King
of Terrors as one knows that he would have wished
to do, but all, all is in other hands than ours.</p>

<p>“I have said nothing of your letter, dear Owen, my
heart is too full. Let me answer it in person. Both
Flora and I look for your return with eagerness and
hope to persuade you to come to us at least for a day
or two. You knew our loved one, and it is not so long
since you and he met. How I envy you that meeting
now! We have heard of it all in detail, I know, but
you will have patience, and go over it all once more
with us. The only thing that gives one courage to
face the present (saving always that far-reaching Comfort
which one <i>knows</i> to be there, but which poor humanity
cannot always <i>feel</i>) is a mournful, tender lingering
over the past. Nor must you fear that I always
weep, dear Owen—there is often absolute rest and joy
in dwelling on the past happiness that one knows to
be only a shadow and faint forecasting of the Joy that
is to come.</p>

<p>“Bless you, dear fellow, and though I have said so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
little of thanks for all the sympathy and understanding
in your dear letter, do not think of me as anything
but profoundly touched and grateful.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Sorrowfully and ever affectionately yours,</span><br />

“<span class="smcap">Fenwick Morchard</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Quentillian folded the letter and put it away.</p>

<p>He mentally visualized the silent and grief-stricken
house, and his heart contracted strangely.</p>

<p>Valeria had gone, and would come back no more.
Her heart was given to her new life, to her new country.
Lucilla was with her. Adrian—the Adrian of
the Canon’s tender love and pride—had never been.
David, who had not wanted to come home, who had
left “long intervals” between his scanty letters—David
was dead.</p>

<p>There was only Flora left at St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>He thought that he could see her, remote and austere,
either devoid of capability for human emotion, or regarding
emotional display as rebellion against Heaven.
He had never known which. Flora would move about
the cold, silent house, and write the letters, and give
the orders, and remember the sane, everyday things
that must be done. She would be helped by the eager,
anxious curate. Mr. Clover would remember things,
too, but he would not, like Flora, accomplish them in
silence. He would suggest, and remind, and humbly
and timidly deprecate his own efforts.</p>

<p>Quentillian could see the Canon, too.</p>

<p>The Canon would spare himself nothing, but he
would break down, with gusts of overwhelming sorrow
and bitter remorse for his own want of resignation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
He would write, and write, and write, in the
lonely study, often blinded with tears, yet deriving
his realest comfort from the outward expression of his
grief.</p>

<p>Quentillian could accept that, now, could realize it
as the interpretation of a sincerity at least as complete
as his own.</p>

<p>Within the fortnight, he went to St. Gwenllian. It
was all very much as he had pictured it to himself.
Only Flora was a little, a very little, less remote than
he had expected to find her.</p>

<p>He thought that she dreaded the arrival of the letters
from India, and feared their effect upon her
father.</p>

<p>When the mail did arrive, the letters were brief, and
said that David Morchard had died in hospital of
dysentery after three days’ illness. The colonel of the
regiment wrote in praise of a career interrupted abruptly,
and a parcel of effects was promised.</p>

<p>There was no more.</p>

<p>“Such letters have become so sadly common in the
last few years,” said the Canon wistfully. “How can
one hope that in each individual case the writer will
realize the yearning with which one looks for one
personal touch—one word to show that all was well.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will write from the hospital—the
chaplain or the matron,—when they send the things,”
Quentillian suggested.</p>

<p>He, too, was faintly disappointed and puzzled at the
reticence of the letters.</p>

<p>Flora’s face, set in its sad composure, told him
nothing of her feelings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>But the day following brought him enlightenment
from Flora herself.</p>

<p>They were sent out for a walk together.</p>

<p>“Take her for a walk, dear Owen,” said the Canon
solicitously. “Flora is pale, and cold. She has shut
herself up too much of late. Go, my child, I shall
do very well, and can find only too much to occupy
me. Enjoy the fresh air.”</p>

<p>Flora made no protestations of inability to enjoy
herself, nor any assumption of indispensability at
home. It was the Canon, again, who suggested an
errand to a distant cottage, and she acquiesced without
comment.</p>

<p>It was a cold, grey day, with swiftly moving masses
of cloud and a chill in the wind. Flora and Owen
walked quickly, and at first neither spoke. Then Flora
said:</p>

<p>“How much, exactly, were you a friend of
David’s?”</p>

<p>His own surprise made Quentillian realize afresh
how very seldom it was that Flora initiated any topic
of a personal nature.</p>

<p>“We were not intimate,” he replied.</p>

<p>“It was more the time that you spent with us here,
when you were a little boy, than anything else, that
established a relationship between you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was.”</p>

<p>“I think you are very much interested in people, and
Lucilla says that you are very observant,” said Flora,
smiling a little. “Would you mind telling me, quite
dispassionately, if David was popular with other men—the
officers in his regiment, for instance?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>He did not understand at what her question aimed,
but replied with unhesitating candour.</p>

<p>“I should say he was very popular. He was a good
sportsman, and everyone liked him, although as far
as I know he wasn’t a man of intimate friendships.
That type isn’t.”</p>

<p>“No. You see, Owen, there have been no letters
from people who were in India with him, although you
say he was popular. Only just those few lines from
the Colonel. And I was afraid before—and I’m afraid
now—” She stopped.</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“That it wasn’t dysentery, or anything like that.
That they’re keeping the truth from us out of pity,
or to save some scandal. I—I can’t get it out of my
mind, Owen.”</p>

<p>He heard her with something that was not altogether
surprise. Subconsciously, he felt that his own
uneasiness had been only dormant.</p>

<p>“Have you anything beyond intuition, to go upon?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why have you told me?”</p>

<p>He felt certain that she had not spoken merely in
order to be reassured, nor in order to find relief.
Speaking was no relief to Flora, so far as Owen could
see.</p>

<p>“I want you to try and find out definitely.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And supposing I do, supposing that what you
fear is true—” he hesitated.</p>

<p>“That David took his own life?” said Flora, shuddering.
“Then, don’t you see, Owen, I shall have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
to tell Father—or else to make it absolutely certain
that no one will ever tell him.”</p>

<p>“You can’t,” said Owen gently.</p>

<p>“But I must,” she told him, with the same intensity.
“He’s had a great deal to bear already, and this would
be worse than anything. Suicide is a mortal sin.
Bodily separation, one can resign oneself to—he <i>is</i>
resigning himself, poor Father, to separation from
nearly all those whom he loves,—but suicide would
mean eternal separation. It would be worse than
anything—the loss of David’s soul.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Quentillian did indeed see.</p>

<p>“Val, and Adrian, and David—they’ve all gone
away from him,” said Flora. “Only he knows there
is another life, so much more real and enduring than
this one, to which he looks. It means everything to
him. If David did do—that—then the hope of meeting
him again, in eternity, is gone.”</p>

<p>Quentillian felt the force of her low-spoken,
anguished statement.</p>

<p>“You are taking it for granted that a suspicion—which
after all, rests on very little indeed—is true.”</p>

<p>“You see, if I am to safeguard my father from this
thing, I can’t very well afford to wait and do nothing,
just because there’s quite a big chance that it isn’t true
at all. The chance that it <i>is</i> true, may be infinitesimal—the
hundredth chance, if you like—but it’s that
which I’ve got to think about, not the other. Optimism
doesn’t carry one far enough, in preparing a line
of defence.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“I don’t think that either you or I are optimists,
Owen,” said Flora, faintly smiling.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I want you to help me. Can you make
enquiries at any of the headquarter places in London
where they might know something?”</p>

<p>“I can try.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Flora, as though his
unenthusiastic assent had closed the subject.</p>

<p>They went along the muddy road in silence.</p>

<p>It was from no sense that it was necessary to break
it, that Quentillian spoke again at last.</p>

<p>“Will Lucilla come back to England at once?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. She promised to stay till the
spring. You know Val has another little boy? I wish
we could see them, but Father will never really be happy
about Val, I’m afraid. He forgave her, long ago, but
he doesn’t forget things, ever, I don’t think.”</p>

<p>“I don’t consider that the Canon had anything to
forgive,” said Quentillian in tones of finality.</p>

<p>“But <i>he</i> does.”</p>

<p>If Quentillian had expected a certain meed of recognition
for the magnanimity of his point of view, he
was not destined to be gratified. Flora spoke rather
as one giving utterance to an obvious platitude.</p>

<p>“Is Val happy?”</p>

<p>“Very. She has exactly what she always really
wanted. Sometimes they have a servant, but most of
the time she does everything herself, and has occasional
help. She is so happy with the two little boys, too, all
her letters are about them, and about the house, and
all they’re doing to improve it. She’s got the life that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
she was really meant for, and after all, isn’t that what
makes happiness?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is. She was meant for the primitive
things, you think?”</p>

<p>“Lucilla always said so. There is the cottage, Owen.
Will you wait outside, or come in?”</p>

<p>“I should like to come in with you.”</p>

<p>Life was inartistic, Quentillian reflected whimsically,
while Flora delivered her father’s message to a middle-aged
woman in an apron.</p>

<p>To accord with all literary conventions, there should
have been a sick child in the cottage, and Flora’s tender
soothing of its fretfulness should have proved a revelation
of the unfulfilled maternal instinct within her.</p>

<p>But there was no sick child to provide a <i>clou</i> for
Quentillian’s observations in psychology, and he was
by no means assured of Flora’s powers of soothing.
Rather would she urge the silence of resignation.</p>

<p>He was convinced that never in her life had Flora
Morchard been the centre of a pretty picture. That
her personality seldom dominated any scene was not,
he felt, from any conscious effacement, but from an
innate and instinctive withdrawal of her forces to some
unseen objective, to her infinitely worth while. He
reflected with dismay on his own undertaking to make
enquiries concerning the death of David Morchard.
But he did not think that Flora, whatever the result of
the enquiries, would be dismayed. Dismay implied
mental disarray, a quality of taken-abackness. Flora,
as she would herself have told him, was strong in a
strength not her own.</p>

<p>They walked back together almost in silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Your little expedition did Flora good,” the Canon
told Quentillian that evening. “I am grateful to you,
dear fellow, very grateful. Let us see something of
you still, from Stear. It means a great deal to us
both. There must not be ‘good-bye’ between us, save
for the beautiful old meaning of the word, ‘God by
you.’ God by you always, dear Owen.”</p>

<p>Quentillian went to London, made no discoveries at
all, and wrote to Flora.</p>

<p>She replied, thanking him, in the briefest of notes.
A week later he received another letter from her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Owen</span>:</p>

<p>“The Indian mail came in yesterday, and brought
me a letter from David, written a week before he died.
He asked me to break it to my father that a Major
Carey, in his regiment, was on his way home to take
divorce proceedings against his wife, citing David as
co-respondent. David asked me in the letter to do
anything I could for Mrs. Carey, as she is by herself,
with no relations in England. The case was to be undefended,
and David had decided to leave the Army
and come to England as soon as possible to marry
Mrs. Carey. I gather that he was very unhappy, especially
at having to leave the regiment. I still do not
know whether he found a dreadful solution to the
whole question, in taking his own life.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carey has written to Father, a strange note,
which he showed me. She says nothing of the divorce
proceedings, but only writes as a great friend of
David’s, imploring to be allowed to see us. Naturally,
Father is only too anxious to see her, and as she says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
that she is on her way to Scotland at once, we are coming
to London on the 10th so as to meet her.</p>

<p>“I have told Father nothing whatever of David’s
letter to me. I cannot imagine that Mrs. Carey will
want to make the facts known to him, but I shall be
able to judge better when I have seen her, which I
have decided to do, by myself, before the appointment
with Father.</p>

<p>“I can arrange this a great deal better with your help
than without it, therefore will you come and see us on
the evening we arrive—Thursday the 10th, at about six
o’clock, Carrowby’s Hotel?</p>

<p>“Please destroy this letter.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours sincerely,</span><br />

“<span class="smcap">Flora Morchard</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Quentillian, as he read Flora’s unvarnished statements,
felt a sensation as of being appalled.</p>

<p>He could not believe that Flora, fanatically single-minded
as her determination to shield her father from
the knowledge of the truth might be, had any conception
of the difficulties that probably lay before her, and
he asked himself also whether she had in any degree
realized what the consequences must be to the Canon,
far more than to herself, of a deception that should
break down half way.</p>

<p>His absolute conviction of Flora’s inflexibility, and
his own strong sense of the impertinence, in both the
proper and the colloquial sense of the word, of offering
unasked advice, were not enough to restrain him from
the mental composition of several eloquent and elaborate
expositions of opinion. But they sufficed to restrain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
him from transferring the eloquence to a sheet
of notepaper.</p>

<p>He went to Carrowby’s Hotel, to keep the appointment
summarily made by Flora.</p>

<p>“You dear man!”</p>

<p>The Canon’s exclamation of pleasure rang through
the dingy hotel sitting-room in which Quentillian
found them. He always showed the same pleasure in
seeing Owen, and Owen’s old sense of inadequacy had
insensibly given place to a rather remorseful gratitude.</p>

<p>“Is this the doing of Flora? She told me that she
should notify you of our coming, but it is good to
meet with a friend’s face so early. Our stay is to be a
very brief one. I have to return home for the Sunday.
I cannot leave all in Clover’s hands. Besides, I trust
there will be no need. You know the errand on which
we are come?”</p>

<p>“I told him in my letter,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“This lady, this Mrs. Carey, had seen much of our
dear fellow in India and her letter is full of feeling—full
of feeling. She heard nothing of our tragedy until
she landed in England. It seems that she had been
in ill-health for some time, she writes of complete
prostration, and is on her way to Scotland now. So
you will understand our hasty journey hither. Has it
not indeed been with us, ‘Ask and ye shall receive’?
Flora, here, knows what my yearning has been for one
word with those who knew him, who had been with
him recently. And behold! it has been given unto me,
‘full measure, heaped up, pressed down and running
over’.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>The Canon leant back. He looked very tired and
old.</p>

<p>“Do you see her tomorrow morning, sir?”</p>

<p>“We go to her, Owen. She is good enough to receive
us on Saturday morning, and I understand that
she leaves that evening. Tomorrow I have a conference
in the afternoon, but the morning is our own.”</p>

<p>He gazed wistfully at Owen.</p>

<p>“I had thought of a memorial window to the beloved
David, and this is an opportunity which may
not come again. I have the name of a place to which
I half thought of going, if it be not too trying for
little Flora.”</p>

<p>“Let me accompany you,” said Quentillian.</p>

<p>It was evidently what the Canon wished.</p>

<p>“Will you, dear lad? I own that I should be glad
of your arm, aye, and your presence. Flora is overwrought
and overtired.”</p>

<p>She did indeed look very ill, not at all to Quentillian’s
surprise.</p>

<p>“She has been taking too much thought for me, dear
child,” said the Canon, Quentillian could not help
thinking with more truth than he realized. “I wish
Flora to take some rest. Let the expedition tomorrow
be yours and mine, Owen. Tell me, my daughter,
what time am I free?”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow morning, till twelve o’clock. Your conference
is at two.”</p>

<p>“Flora is my deputy secretary,” said the Canon smiling.
“I trust it all to her, and her memory is unfailing.
She is indeed my right hand.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Will you come at ten o’clock tomorrow, Owen, and
start from here?” said Flora abruptly.</p>

<p>He assented, determined to obtain an opportunity
of speaking to her alone. If he was to assist Flora in
a scheme of concealment against which he inwardly revolted
strongly, he must at least know of what that
scheme consisted. His indignation waxed in proportion
to his anxiety, until Flora said to him with deliberation:</p>

<p>“Ought we to keep you any longer, Owen? I’ll ring
for the lift.” The suggestion took them both out of
the room, and she closed the door after her.</p>

<p>“What is it you’re doing?” said Quentillian, his
urgency too great for a choice of words.</p>

<p>She leant against the passage wall, white and
rather breathless, but spoke low and very distinctly,
as though to impress her facts upon him.</p>

<p>“Listen—I want you to be quite clear about it. The
appointment with Mrs. Carey is for tomorrow—Friday
morning. I’m going to her house. I’m certain
from her letter, that she’s not a woman to be trusted.
I don’t know why she wants to see us, but I think it’s
to tell us things—things about David. I shall know
when I’ve seen her.”</p>

<p>“But your father thinks the appointment is for Saturday?”</p>

<p>“I told him it was. I wrote the letter to arrange it.”</p>

<p>“And how are you to prevent his going there on
Saturday?”</p>

<p>“She leaves for Scotland on Friday night.”</p>

<p>“You know that for certain?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do, Owen. One doesn’t leave these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
things to chance. But I shall telephone on Saturday
and find out if she’s really left.”</p>

<p>“I still don’t understand altogether. How can you
explain to the Canon that this lady isn’t there, when
he goes by appointment to see her?”</p>

<p>“I shall have made a mistake. I’m keeping his engagements
written down for him. And I shall have
written down this engagement for Saturday, instead of
for Friday. He will go exactly one day too late.”</p>

<p>“Flora, you can’t do it.”</p>

<p>She lifted tired eyes to his face, overwrought to the
point of fanaticism.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste time. Only tell me if I can count on
you. All I want you to do is to keep Father out, with
you, tomorrow morning. I shall be at Mrs. Carey’s at
half-past ten and I promise to be back here before one
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Suppose this lady is not what you think her, and
you find that she will be—discreet—is your father to
be disappointed of his hopes of seeing her?”</p>

<p>“I may be able to arrange something. Perhaps she’d
put off going to Scotland, and see him on Saturday
after all. It would be all right then, wouldn’t it? Or
I might even be able to tell her the whole thing,” said
Flora wistfully. “It isn’t very likely, though.”</p>

<p>He did not think that it was.</p>

<p>“You see, you didn’t see her original letter, and I
did. It was the letter of a very hysterical person. She
might say almost anything, I imagine and—well,
there’s a good deal that mustn’t be said, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>It was incontrovertible, but Quentillian said roughly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“I detest maneuvering, it’s utterly unworthy of you.
All this juggling with dates and letters——”</p>

<p>“It’s no use doing things by halves,” said Flora
stubbornly. “Yes or no, Owen, are you going to back
me up if necessary?”</p>

<p>“If I say no, will it deter you from going through
with this insane performance?”</p>

<p>“Of course it won’t.” She actually smiled. “What
would be the sense of making up one’s mind if it’s to
be unmade again just because one’s friends don’t agree
with one?”</p>

<p>“Very well.” He shrugged his shoulders as one in
desperation.</p>

<p>She evidently accepted it as the assent, however ungracious,
that he meant it to be.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Flora with brief
finality.</p>


<h3>(iii)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Flora</span> followed Mrs. Carey’s maid upstairs, feeling
as though the beating of her heart were causing each
breath she drew to crowd thickly upon the next one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carey’s house—she supposed it was Mrs.
Carey’s house—was a very tiny one indeed, and looked
tinier by reason of the number of pictures, draperies,
and flowers that covered every available corner of the
steep staircase and the small landing.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was small, too, and so dark that
the maid turned on the rose-shaded electric lights as she
ushered Flora into the empty room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Mrs. Carey isn’t down yet. I’ll tell her you’re here,
m’m.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carey is expecting me. Please say that it is
Miss Morchard.”</p>

<p>The maid went away.</p>

<p>“Unpunctual,” reflected Flora. “She said half-past
ten.”</p>

<p>She gazed round the room, which confirmed the impression
of Mrs. Carey’s personality that Flora had already
received from her pale mauve notepaper, her
methods of expressing herself in writing, and that
which she knew of her relations with David Morchard.</p>

<p>Nearly everything in the room was rose-colour, except
the walls, which were grey, and laden with
sketches, brackets, and a shelf on which stood innumerable
framed and unframed photographs, nearly all
of them of men.</p>

<p>A minute writing-table, set corner ways, overflowed
with papers, and more photographs, including one that
Flora recognized instantly, although it had never been
sent to St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>The chair in front of the table supported a number
of illustrated papers.</p>

<p>“Untidy,” was Flora’s next verdict.</p>

<p>She had resolutely closed the avenues of her mind
to emotion and speculation alike. The habits of observation,
which she mentioned in private spiritual consultation
with her father as her own tendency towards
a lack of charity, she knew subconsciously to possess
a steadying effect.</p>

<p>A quantity of cigarette ash in a small receptacle, presumably
placed there on the previous evening, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
general atmosphere of unopened windows, did not
serve to modify Flora’s already unenthusiastic judgments.</p>

<p>Neither did Mrs. Carey’s delay in making her appearance.</p>

<p>When she at last came in, it was difficult to see what
could possibly have delayed her, since she had apparently
only stepped out of bed into a wadded silk
kimono, a lace boudoir cap, and fur-bordered bedroom
slippers.</p>

<p>She looked younger than Flora had expected her to
be, and her little pallid face was pretty enough, with
violet semi-circles under big, light blue eyes and a
general air of fragility. Although nearly as tall as
Flora herself, she was slight enough to produce an
effect of daintiness, the adjective that Flora immediately
felt certain would appeal to her most.</p>

<p>A short, thick plait of fair hair fell over her shoulders,
and a certain babyish plaintiveness of utterance
made Flora think of Olga Duffle.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’re David’s sister,” said Mrs. Carey, to
which proof of intuition her visitor offered no reply,
thinking the fact sufficiently self-evident.</p>

<p>“Oh, do sit down. You must forgive me coming
in like this, but I’m not strong, and I arrived worn out
after an awful voyage—and then to get this news!
Do you smoke?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I do? I smoke too much, but my
nerves are in an awful state. A doctor friend of mine—the
dearest thing—made me promise faithfully never
to inhale, but I’m afraid I do. It was the ship’s doctor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
on the way home, as a matter of fact. There were one
or two nice men on board, but the women were dreadful.
Miss Morchard, I should think other women generally
confide in you, don’t they, and like you most
awfully. Now, I’m <i>not</i> enormously popular with other
women. I don’t mean that I haven’t got women-friends,
devoted ones, who’d do anything in the world
for me—but most of my very best pals have been men.
It’s funny, isn’t it? Your brother was one of my
<i>dearest</i> friends.”</p>

<p>The blue eyes looked warily at Flora.</p>

<p>“That’s why I felt I had to see you, and oh! you are
so like him! It’s hardly like talking to a stranger at
all!”</p>

<p>It certainly was not, Flora reflected.</p>

<p>“I feel I’m so dreadfully in the dark—I know nothing.
Only the awful, awful fact. When I got the
cable—it was cabled to me, by a dear friend at Government
House—when I read it, I simply didn’t believe
it. I said, ‘It can’t be true.’ But it was.”</p>

<p>Flora did not feel it incumbent upon her to reply.</p>

<p>“When your father got my letter, I daresay he was
astonished, but I’m frightfully impulsive, Miss
Morchard, and I felt I <i>must</i> know more or I should
go mad. That’s why I begged you to let me see you.
I’m a thoroughly unconventional woman, as you may
perhaps have guessed, and I always act on impulse.”</p>

<p>Flora looked at the frightened, furtive little face,
and wondered what purpose and what concealment lay
behind the flood of words.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be perfectly frank with you, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
I feel I can trust you. May I call you Flora? My
name is Maisie—a silly little name, isn’t it, but my
friends all say it suits me. I don’t know why. Tell
me, did David write to you about me? He said he was
going to, but it was such a—such a short time before——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carey’s tongue moistened her lips as though
they were dry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you’ve ever lived abroad, but
if you haven’t, you don’t know what the East is like
for people who have to live there. There’s a frightful
amount of slander and gossip going on, and people put
a wicked construction on all sorts of innocent things.
It’s awful. It used to make me simply miserable. You
see, live and let live has always been my motto. I like
to go my own way, and have my own friends, and not
do any harm to anybody, but simply be happy in my
own little way. After all, it’s what God meant for all
of us, isn’t it? But in India one can’t do that. My
dear, you wouldn’t believe what it’s like. I went out
when I was awfully young—I was married at twenty—and
I know for a fact that the most beastly things
have been said about me. You see, I feel I can tell you
this quite frankly, Flora, because of your being David’s
favourite sister. I know you’ll understand, and that I
can trust you.”</p>

<p>Again that anxious, furtive glance was shot at her
from under Mrs. Carey’s long lashes.</p>

<p>“I’ve had heaps of men friends, of course—especially
in the Regiment. I’m going to be <i>perfectly</i> honest
with you, and own up that one or two of them got
rather silly, and fancied themselves in love with me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
That wasn’t my fault, was it? I just wanted to be
friends, you know. A nice woman can do such a lot
for young men. I couldn’t help it—possibly—if they
went and fancied themselves in love with me. Now
could I? But would you believe it, people—it was
mostly women, I must say, and some of them
actually called themselves my friends—went and invented
the most disgusting lies about me. Out of jealousy,
you know. I was a good ten years younger than
any of them, as it happened, and you’d have thought
the Colonel’s wife, or anyone like that, might have
wanted to mother me a little bit. (I lost my own
mother when I was only fourteen, and had a rotten
time at home.) But instead of that, my dear, <i>instead</i>
of that, they simply spread these filthy stories about
me and all my best friends. However, I don’t want to
go into all that. It was soon after I first went out, and
of course nobody who really knew me believed for an
instant that there was anything in it. They heard
something about it at Government House, you know,
and the Governor was simply furious, I believe. My
friend in the Secretariat told me about it. The Governor
said that Mrs. Carey was the only real lady in
the place, as well as being the prettiest woman in India.
Of course, that may have been nonsense, because I happen
to know that he did like me most awfully—personally,
I mean—but I know I was most awfully
touched at his taking up the cudgels for me like that.
It showed what the people who really <i>mattered</i> thought
of me, didn’t it, and after all, the Governor of a place
does represent the King, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Flora.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>It was the first appeal to which she had felt able to
give any assent.</p>

<p>“You said that so like David!” cried Mrs. Carey
clasping her hands together. “We were the greatest
friends, and he used to come to me about everything.
I used to tell him to marry....”</p>

<p>Another pause, and another look.</p>

<p>“I always want my young-men friends to marry.
That just shows, doesn’t it, what nonsense it is for
anyone to talk as though there were anything wrong
about it? I don’t know whether your brother ever
hinted anything to you, in his letters, about any horrid
gossip. Between ourselves, he used to get angry, I
know, at the things that were sometimes said, and of
course he knew that I wasn’t—well, very happy.
You’re not married, I know, so perhaps you won’t understand
what it means to a woman, especially a very
sensitive one, which I am, to have a husband who is
jealous. I’m not blaming Fred, exactly, I suppose he
can’t help it, and he was madly in love with me when
we married. Of course, I was much too young and
ignorant of life to marry, but I had an awfully unhappy
home, and if it hadn’t been Fred, it would have
been somebody else—men were always pestering me,
somehow. Besides, people made mischief between us.
How people can be wicked enough to come between
husband and wife, I can’t think! I’ve been through
hell once or twice in my life, I can tell you!”</p>

<p>Looking at the fear and the craftiness and the
sensuality written on Maisie Carey’s small, ravaged
face, Flora could believe it without difficulty.</p>

<p>“I don’t really know why I’m telling you all this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
exactly. It’s not like me. I’m terribly reserved, really.
But you’ve got such an awfully nice face, somehow,
and you’re David’s sister. I can’t tell you how fond
I was of David—we were just tremendous chums. It
upset me awfully, that he should die in that sudden
way.”</p>

<p>She began to cry in a convulsive, spasmodic way.</p>

<p>Flora still remained silent.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d tell me if he ever wrote anything to
you about me,” sobbed Mrs. Carey.</p>

<p>In the midst of the tears which seemed to be really
beyond her own control, Flora caught a glimpse as of
a terrible anxiety. She suddenly knew that in the answer
to that last, sobbed-out question lay, for Mrs.
Carey, the crux of their interview.</p>

<p>“He did write,” said Flora. “But what he wrote is
safe with me. It will never go any further.”</p>

<p>The figure in the gay silk kimono seemed to cower
further back into the armchair, but there was no self-betraying
exclamation.</p>

<p>“I suppose he told you about Fred and me?”</p>

<p>“And about himself too,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“Men are all alike! Why did he want to tell you?”</p>

<p>“So that I could tell my father and sister. David
was afraid of Father.”</p>

<p>“Your father knows?” This time the note of alarm
was undisguised.</p>

<p>“No. The letter was only found and posted after
the ones that told us of David’s death. And I have
told my father nothing.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carey broke into vehement, hysterical speech.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to tell! You people at home make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
such mountains out of molehills. I swear to you that
there was nothing between us, that I never——”</p>

<p>Flora interrupted her.</p>

<p>“He told me everything,” she repeated. “He told
me that the case would be undefended, and that he
was coming home to marry you. So you see I know.”</p>

<p>“You! What can you, who’ve never married, never
seen anything of life, know of things? You see evil
where none exists—you’re like all these good and holy
people ... intolerant....” Tears poured
unchecked down her face, making streaks across the
white powder. “You don’t even <i>begin</i> to know what
I’ve gone through. My husband is a beast—a <i>beast</i>.
You don’t know what that means.”</p>

<p>She flung herself backwards, almost prone, and wept
hysterically.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” said Flora.</p>

<p>“Kill myself!”</p>

<p>The rhetorical answer came almost automatically.</p>

<p>Flora waited for a moment and then said very
gently:</p>

<p>“As you say, I don’t know anything about these
things, but perhaps you would tell me what you want.
We might think of some way of making things better.
And you can see for yourself that your secret—and
David’s—is safe with me. I’ve deceived my father,
sooner than let him guess. I don’t think he need
ever know, now.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you want him to know?” said Mrs.
Carey with sudden curiosity that seemed to check her
crying.</p>

<p>“It would make him very unhappy. He was proud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of David and he thinks that David had a career before
him. Perhaps you’ve read in books,” said Flora,
speaking as though to a child, “about people thinking
death is better than dishonour. Well, my father is
like that.”</p>

<p>“He’s a parson, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carey shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Where is your husband now?” Flora enquired. She
felt that she could ask this woman questions without
fear or rebuff, but she thought that it would be for her
to disentangle the truth from the false in Mrs. Carey’s
replies.</p>

<p>“Fred’s in Scotland. He’s staying with his mother.
She’s a beastly old woman and I hate her. If she’d
been a decent sort, you’d think she’d have used her
influence to put things right between us, now wouldn’t
you? But she’s never let Fred alone ever since we
married. Always telling him tales about me, and saying
I’m extravagant, and a flirt, and wanting to know
why I’ve never had a baby. It’s not my fault if I’ve
got rotten health, now is it? I’ve always been delicate.
I’m sure I only wish I had got a child. It might
have made Fred nicer to me, and I should have had
something to care for.”</p>

<p>She began to cry again.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know why I’m telling you all this.
Perhaps you think I’m mad.”</p>

<p>“I’m dreadfully sorry for you,” said Flora truthfully.</p>

<p>“You’re a dear.” Mrs. Carey dropped the hostility
out of her voice abruptly. “No one knows what I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
gone through. And now about David—it’s simply
awful!”</p>

<p>“Did you really mean to marry David, after your
divorce?”</p>

<p>“I’d better tell you the whole story, I suppose,” said
Mrs. Carey. She dried her eyes and her voice insensibly
hardened from self-pity into tones of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ve always been attractive to men. I
can’t help it, after all. And I daresay I’ve played the
fool, in my time—in fact I don’t deny it. But David
and I were simply tremendous friends, to begin with.
He was frightfully sorry for me, too. Everybody knew
that Fred was simply hateful to me, and made a scene
if I so much as went out riding with another man. He
quite liked your brother, though, at first, I will say
that for him. We used to have him to dinner pretty
often, and one of the subalterns to make a fourth, and
play Bridge. Well, I never guessed that your brother
did more than just like me as a great friend, as heaps
of men did—how could I? I used to advise him to
marry, often and often. Some nice girl at home, who’d
come out and look after him. Those boys all drink
more than is good for them, out there, if they’ve no
wife to look after them. And David used to talk nonsense
about having no use for girls, and having met
his ideal too late, but of course I never took it seriously.
Heaps of men say things like that to one, now don’t
they? We used to go out riding together a good deal,
and of course I danced with him. (That’s another of
the ways in which Fred is so frightfully selfish. He
can’t dance himself ever since he was wounded in the
war, so he hates me to.) Then people began to say the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
usual horrid things. The women out there are all cats,
and besides, a good many of them wanted David for
themselves. I didn’t take any notice. I think it’s so
much more dignified not to, don’t you? As I said to
the Colonel’s wife, when she had the impertinence to
speak to me about it, I never <i>have</i> taken any notice of
gossip, and I’m not going to begin now. I simply go
my own way, and let people say what they choose. It
doesn’t matter to me if they’ve got horrible minds. It’s
themselves that are hurt by it, I always think, not me.
But I think women are much braver and more unconventional
than men, don’t you? David minded ever so
much more than I did, when he found people were
talking about us. Well, things were going from bad
to worse between Fred and me, and one night he was so
perfectly hateful to me that I got frightened. He was—not
drunk, but not altogether sober. And I ran
into the compound and down the road to David’s bungalow.
He shared it with another man, but the other
man was away shooting. You see, I was so frightened
and upset that I didn’t know what I was doing, and
I just felt I must go to someone who’d take care of
me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carey swallowed, as though something in her
throat were hurting her, and lit another cigarette with
a hand that trembled.</p>

<p>“It was a frightfully imprudent thing to do, I suppose,
but I’ve never pretended to be a particularly
prudent woman. I daresay I should have been much
happier if I’d been less impulsive, all my life, but after
all, one can’t change one’s nature, can one? Besides,
I was nearly out of my mind. Fred came to find me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
next morning. I was far too miserable and terrified
to go back to him that night. We had scene after scene,
after that, and he threatened me with divorce proceedings.”</p>

<p>She glanced at her motionless auditor.</p>

<p>“I may have been a careless fool, and I’ll go as far
as to say that I’ve flirted with other men, but it was
wicked of Fred to think of such a thing as divorce—to
ruin my reputation, and spoil David’s career.”</p>

<p>“Why was the case to be undefended?” said Flora
steadily.</p>

<p>“Why—why, don’t you see, when it all came to a
crisis, I told David how utterly wretched my whole
life was, and how I couldn’t bear it and should kill
myself, and we had to talk things over, and see what
could be done with Fred, who was like a madman.
And then it all came out—I mean David said I was
the only woman he could ever care for, and if I was
free, wouldn’t I marry him, and let him try to make
up to me for everything.”</p>

<p>“Why was the case to be undefended?”</p>

<p>“It would make less of a scandal if it was all done
quietly. I—I didn’t feel I could face the other.”</p>

<p>In the truth of that last assertion, Flora could believe
absolutely.</p>

<p>“I think I know the rest,” she said. “David was
going to send in his papers, and come home to England
as soon as possible after you and Major Carey,
and you’d promised to marry him when the decree had
been made absolute.”</p>

<p>“How do you know those legal terms?” said Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Carey, pouting like a child that is trying to show
displeasure.</p>

<p>Flora did not pursue the irrelevance. She was following
a chain of thought in her own mind.</p>

<p>“David <i>was</i> in love with this woman. Otherwise
he wouldn’t have written and asked me to do anything
I could for her. As for leaving the case undefended—well,
they probably hadn’t got a defence to put up.
He meant to marry her—probably wanted to marry her.
Besides he’d have felt that he owed it to her. And
though he was afraid of Father, and very unhappy
about sending in his papers, and though he may have
had glimpses of what she really is—David wasn’t the
sort to let her down. <i>He didn’t kill himself.</i>”</p>

<p>The certainty came to Flora with a rush of relief
so profound that she could almost have thanked little
Mrs. Carey for unwittingly bringing her to it.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of her that, instead, she glanced
at her watch and said:</p>

<p>“I can only stay another twenty minutes, and we
shall probably not meet again. Are you going to Scotland
tonight?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I am. Fred is there now, at his mother’s,
telling her all sorts of horrible things about me, I
suppose. They’ve both written to me.”</p>

<p>“What is your husband going to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” She began to cry again. “His
mother, for once in her life, wants to patch things up
between us. She’s one of your religious people, and
she thinks divorce is awful.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether a divorce is still possible, now
that David——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>Mrs. Carey broke into a sort of howl that, in its
reminiscence of a beaten animal, made Flora feel
sick.</p>

<p>“That’s just it—Fred <i>is</i> a beast! He thinks there
were other people—other men—as well.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Flora, and shuddered violently.</p>

<p>“You’ve been rather a dear, so I don’t mind telling
you that your brother is out of it now, whatever happened.
Oh, I don’t know what’ll happen. I never
cared for anybody like I did for David—never. I was
ready to go through anything for him, and we could
have started fresh somewhere, and no one would have
thought anything of it. People aren’t so narrow-minded
as they used to be. He’s the only man I’ve
ever loved!”</p>

<p>Flora felt no inclination to point out to the unhappy
woman the inconsistency of her various statements.</p>

<p>She even found it easy enough to believe that Maisie
Carey for the moment thought herself to be speaking
the truth when she said that David was the only man
she had ever loved.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for you,” she said gently. “And I’m
grateful to you, because you’ve taken a great weight
off my mind. My brother asked me to do anything I
could for you. Is there anything?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what <i>you</i> could do, I’m sure. It isn’t
even as though you were married. Not that you
haven’t been sweet to me, listening like this. You do
believe in me, don’t you? Even if you hear beastly
stories about me, ever, you’ll know they aren’t true,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>She put out a hand that still trembled, to Flora, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
she went on speaking rapidly, as though not daring to
wait for an assent that might not come.</p>

<p>“You’re awfully like David, in some ways, you know.
It’s been a comfort to see you. Don’t tell your father
about my troubles. Just say I was a friend of David’s,
you know. I’m glad he didn’t come with you. I hate
parsons, if you’ll excuse me for saying so, and I’m so
frightfully nervous and upset that I might have said
anything. I wish you could have seen Fred—he always
says I haven’t got any decent women-friends. Perhaps
you could have made him give me another chance.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think he will?”</p>

<p>“How do I know? He’s written me a horrid letter,
and pages and pages of cant from my mother-in-law.
I believe if I promised to live at their hateful place,
right away in Scotland, and keep within my allowance,
and never have any fun at all, Fred would chuck the
army and manage the estate for his mother. Can you
see me in thick boots and a billycock hat, trudging up
and down those hills to go and carry tracts to some
wretched old woman in a cottage?”</p>

<p>She laughed melodramatically.</p>

<p>“No,” said Flora, “I can’t see you doing that. But
I shouldn’t think you’d have to. Couldn’t you come
here, for part of the year?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I could. I don’t know. Fred got this
house to please me, when we were first married. He’d
have done anything for me, then. I little knew what a
life he was going to lead me later on!”</p>

<p>Flora rose.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go. I will burn the letter that David
wrote me, about you. Only one person knows what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
was in it, besides myself, and he will never repeat it.”</p>

<p>“Was that your father?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no. My father <i>mustn’t</i> know, ever.”</p>

<p>Flora paused for a moment, then judged that it
would be useless to make any appeal to Mrs. Carey’s
discretion. For her own sake, she might keep silence
as to her relationship with David Morchard, and a
fresh emotional disturbance would eventually displace
the episode—to her, it could be no more—from her
mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carey looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>“Of course, I remember you told me that your father
didn’t know. Then are you engaged?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Flora, colouring slightly.</p>

<p>“All men are beasts—you’re quite right to have
nothing to do with them. I’ve had such a rotten time,
what with Fred’s jealousy, and other men never letting
me alone, that I sometimes wish I’d stayed an old
maid, like you,” said Mrs. Carey.</p>

<p>Flora recognized the impulse that sought to inflict
a scratch, where Mrs. Carey’s self-revelation had left
her vanity disturbed with the instinctive fear that she
had not been taken at her own valuation.</p>

<p>She said good-bye to her.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you know what happens,” Mrs. Carey promised.
“I feel you really <i>do</i> care, you know. I shall
think of you when I’m taking that horrid journey tonight
all the way to Scotland. Perhaps I really will
settle down there, if Fred is willing to make it up, and
if he lets me have a decent allowance, and part of the
year over here.”</p>

<p>She no longer looked desperate, and she bent over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
the banisters and waved to Flora with the little handkerchief
that was still drenched by the tears she had
been shedding.</p>

<p>Flora did not suppose that she should ever hear
from her. Impressions made upon Mrs. Carey seemed
to be transient affairs.</p>

<p>She was conscious of nothing so much as of extreme
physical fatigue, and the intense relief of her new certainty
that David had not, after all, sought the last
desperate remedy. She could be certain of that, now.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Owen won’t understand why I’m so positive
of that now,” she reflected. “But after all, I knew
David. She counted on him, and he’d promised to
marry her. David would never have failed her deliberately—it
wasn’t in him. And he was taken away
from committing a frightful sin. Besides, who knows
how much he repented, poor boy?”</p>

<p>Within a few yards of the hotel, Flora met Quentillian.</p>

<p>He turned and accompanied her to the door.</p>

<p>“David didn’t take his own life, Owen. It was what
they said—he must have been taken ill suddenly.”</p>

<p>“You know for certain?”</p>

<p>“For certain.”</p>

<p>He told her that he understood her relief, but his
next words were:</p>

<p>“And do you still think you were right, about going
alone to this woman?”</p>

<p>“Whether I was right or not, I’m thankful I did.
She would have broken my father’s heart. She was
a sort of—emotion-monger. She’d have spared him
nothing.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“She spared you nothing, then, Flora?”</p>

<p>“It’s different, for me. I would do anything in the
world, for my father’s sake. That’s my only excuse,
possibly, for deceiving him.”</p>

<p>“Do you want excuses?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. You’re right,” she said gravely. “I’ve
planned it all deliberately, and I’ve got to see it
through.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re wrong, all along the line, and I want
to talk it over with you. It will be a bitter disappointment
to the Canon to be told that he has missed seeing
Mrs. Carey.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But you’re going to leave it at that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, more than ever. Owen, when do you go to
Stear?”</p>

<p>“As soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Then could you travel down with us tomorrow?
We go by the three o’clock train. I think it may do
him good, to have you, and you see, he’ll be thinking
that the whole expedition has been a failure. It will
be easier for both of us, if you’re there.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll come.”</p>

<p>They parted, and Flora went to seek her father.
Except from a certain curiosity, it could not be said
that Quentillian looked forward to an agreeable journey.</p>

<p>By the time that he joined Canon Morchard and his
daughter at the railway station, he was beginning to
feel as though the whole of the involved deception perpetrated
with such a conviction of righteousness by
Flora, must have been a figment of imagination. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
glance at the Canon’s sombre and pallid face dispelled
the illusion.</p>

<p>Flora looked pallid also, but her expression was one
of rapt intensity, as though only her own strange
vision, that Quentillian felt to be so singularly perverted,
were before her. She had, undeniably, shielded
her father from knowledge that must have appalled
him, and in that security, remained calm.</p>

<p>The Canon, out of his lesser awareness, had not,
however, remained calm at all.</p>

<p>“I have been angry, Owen,” he admitted, as they
paced the platform together, at the Canon’s own invitation.
“My disappointment has been very bitter.
This lady, this Mrs. Carey, the friend of my dear
boy David, left for Scotland last night. I went to her
house this morning, only to find her gone. Flora,
whom I trusted, had made a mistake of incredible
carelessness. I could not have believed it, in a matter
which <i>must</i> touch us all so nearly, which lay so close
to my own heart. Poor child, she has been highly
tried of late, and I have thought her looking ill. I
should not have trusted to her accuracy. Lucilla, who
has been my right hand, my secretary ever since her
childhood, could never have failed me thus. I forgot
that her sister was younger, unaccustomed to the task,
less to be relied upon. But it has been a cruel disappointment,
and I vented my first grief upon the culprit.
Is there <i>no</i> stage of the journey, Owen, when one can
see the undisciplined impulse driven underfoot, the
hasty word bridled? I, who have striven all my life,
I have again shown anger and violence—to my own
child!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>The Canon’s peculiar predilection for making an
amateur confessor of Quentillian, was by force of
repetition ceasing to seem anything but natural.</p>

<p>Quentillian said: “Flora looks overwrought, sir,”
and inwardly hoped that the train would arrive
shortly.</p>

<p>“Aye, poor Flora! She was David’s especial favourite,
his best correspondent. This stroke has fallen
heavily upon Flora, Owen. And I, who should have
made all allowance, I turned against her! In my sharp
disappointment, I uttered those strong expressions that
come back to one, when the moment’s passion has
cooled, as they must have sounded to the unhappy sinner
by whom they were provoked.”</p>

<p>It was the same piteous round of self-reproach, remorse
and profound depression to which Owen had so
frequently listened. He hoped that he might be of some
assistance, however, incomprehensibly to himself, in
listening yet once again.</p>

<p>“I have written to Mrs. Carey. She must indeed
have thought my behaviour strange, ungrateful, unnatural
even. That matters little enough, yet it adds
its feather weight to the burden—its feather weight to
the burden. That I should have appeared careless, indifferent,
where news of David was concerned! I, who
would have given my heart’s blood, for one hour’s intercourse
with him since he left us for the last time!
Ah, well, it does not bear dwelling upon.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Canon dwelt upon it until it became
necessary to rejoin Flora and enter the train.</p>

<p>During the journey he remained silent, with a profound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
and unhappy silence. His manner towards his
daughter was peculiarly gentle and melancholy.</p>

<p>Presently he leant back in the corner, the sad lines
of his face relaxing, and slept.</p>

<p>Flora spoke to Quentillian in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad he’s asleep. Last night I heard him
walking up and down his room for such a long while.”</p>

<p>“He is very much distressed,” said Quentillian
severely.</p>

<p>“I know.” She acquiesced apathetically in the truth
of the statement.</p>

<p>“Do you know that he has written to Mrs. Carey?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to prevent her replying, and exposing
the fact that you have seen her?”</p>

<p>Flora whitened perceptibly, but she answered him
with sudden spirit.</p>

<p>“You have no right to question me, Owen, or to
demand explanations from me in that tone.”</p>

<p>“I have this right, that you have made me a passive
partner in your extraordinary schemes.”</p>

<p>Owen, too, was conscious of a rising anger.</p>

<p>“I feel like a traitor to your father, Flora. What
are you going to do next?”</p>

<p>“I am going to see it through,” said Flora doggedly.
“At least you will admit that to do a thing like this
by halves, is a great deal worse than useless. I have
saved my father from what must have broken his
heart.”</p>

<p>“You have done evil that good may come,” he quoted
grimly.</p>

<p>“If you like to put it so.” Flora was inexorable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“He has suffered too much already.”</p>

<p>“You mock your own God,” said Quentillian, with
sudden, low vehemence. “You profess to believe in
Him, to trust Him, and yet you deceive and manoeuvre
and plot, sooner than leave your father to his dealings.
I have small belief in a personal God, Flora, but I can
see no justification in endeavouring madly to stand between
another soul, and life.”</p>

<p>She gazed at him piteously.</p>

<p>“Do you think I am not unhappy—that I have not
been torn in two? He was angry, Owen, when he
thought I had made a mistake about the appointment,
and oh, the relief of it! I should have welcomed it if
he had hit me—I deserved it all, and far more besides.
If I am doing wrong, I am suffering for it.”</p>

<p>Quentillian, looking at her haggard, tragic face, felt
sure that she spoke literal truth.</p>

<p>“When does Lucilla come home?” he suddenly asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Soon, I hope.”</p>

<p>Quentillian hoped so too. It seemed to him that
only Lucilla’s normality could adjust to any sort of
balance the mental atmosphere of St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>Flora gazed at her father.</p>

<p>“Think what it would have been to him to know,
now, that David had sinned, even that he contemplated
going through the form of marriage, with that poor
thing! The world’s standards of honour are not those
of my father.”</p>

<p>“Nor yours either,” Quentillian had almost said, but
he checked the cheap retort as it rose.</p>

<p>An impulse made him say instead:</p>

<p>“Promise me at least, Flora, that if this becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
too much for you, if it all breaks down, you will let
me share it with you. You owe it to me, I think, having
let me be partly responsible. Will you promise?”</p>

<p>“You are very good,” said Flora, her mouth quivering
for the first time. “But I don’t mean to fail.”</p>

<p>It was evident enough that her whole being was
strung up to the accomplishment of her purpose, and
that she was incapable of seeing beyond it.</p>

<p>Quentillian, at his own station, parted from Canon
Morchard and his daughter with the direst forebodings.
Insensibly, he, too, had almost come to feel
that anxious preoccupation with the Canon’s peace of
mind that exercised the Canon’s daughters.</p>

<p>Within a fortnight of his return he went over to
St. Gwenllian and found there no trace of catastrophe
such as he had half expected, but the usual atmosphere
of calm melancholy.</p>

<p>He had no conversation with Flora, but she told
him briefly that there would be no correspondence between
her father and Mrs. Carey, and Quentillian
was left to surmise by what peculiar methods Flora had
achieved her ends.</p>

<p>On the whole, he preferred not to dwell upon the subject.
He had a certain unwilling respect for Flora,
even if none for her casuistries, and he had no wish
to dwell either upon her astonishing machinations or
his own complicity.</p>


<h3>(iv)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the spring Lucilla came back to St. Gwenllian.</p>

<p>The first time that Owen saw her was in the presence
of the Canon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>In his relief at her return, Canon Morchard had evidently
forgotten that he had thought it undutiful of her
to go.</p>

<p>“You see I have my right hand once more,” he said
fondly. “Owen here can tell you that you have been
sadly missed, my daughter. Little Flora did her best,
but she is not my housekeeper, my experienced secretary.
Neither she nor our poor Valeria can equal
Lucilla there.”</p>

<p>Quentillian took his advantage and asked Lucilla
for news of Valeria. The Canon, habitually, seemed
only too much inclined to view any mention of Valeria
and her husband as a rank indecency in the presence of
her quondam betrothed.</p>

<p>“Val is very well and very busy,” said Lucilla.
“George is doing well, on the whole, though it’s a struggle,
but the land there is wonderful. I should like to
show you the photographs of their little farm, and the
children.”</p>

<p>“Lucilla is our photographer,” said the Canon forbearingly,
as though in extenuation of what Quentillian
felt certain that he regarded as Lucilla’s indiscretion.</p>

<p>Not for the first time, Quentillian suspected that
Lucilla was the only one of the Canon’s children able
to contemplate the Canon by the light of a sense of
humour, that detracted not at all from her affection
and respect.</p>

<p>“They are not thinking of a visit to England, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“No. Expense is a consideration, and there are
the children.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“My grandsons!” said the Canon. “I should like a
sight of my grandsons, but there could not be unalloyed
joy in the meeting. Nay, I ask myself sometimes
if there can be any unalloyed joy here below. Are not
the warp and woof intermingled even in the nearest
and dearest relationships? And the manner of poor
Valeria’s leaving home was such as to make one’s
heart ache, both for her and with her. But enough of
reminiscences, my children. I am in no mood for them
tonight. I wish to rest, and perhaps read. You may
some of you remember a very favourite old story of
mine,” said Canon Morchard genially. “That of the
famous saying, ‘We are none of us infallible, <i>not even
the youngest</i>.’”</p>

<p>This terrible pronouncement, however historical, seldom
amused the juniors of its <i>raconteur</i>, and Flora
and Lucilla only accorded to it the most perfunctory
of smiles. Owen Quentillian remained entirely grave.</p>

<p>“No one has more admiration than myself for the
quality of infallibility,” the Canon continued, humourously
“(always provided that it is not that which is
claimed by the Pope of Rome), but I must confess that
I am not amongst those who take the modern craze for
youthful intellectuals very seriously. This being so,
dear Owen, you will forgive me in that I have not yet
read anything of yours. Tonight I have a free hour—a
rare treat—and I am going to rectify the omission.
Will you read aloud to us of your work, or is that too
much to ask?”</p>

<p>It was indeed too much to ask, Owen felt.</p>

<p>He could have read his own work aloud with comparative
complacency to any critic capable of taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
it seriously, but to Canon Morchard the slight, cynical
epigrams, the terse, essentially unsentimental rationalism
of Owen’s views upon God and man, must come
either as wanton impertinence, or as meaningless folly.</p>

<p>It was impossible to suppose that the Canon would
keep either opinion to himself, and Quentillian felt it
unlikely that he would either find himself capable of
listening to him tolerantly, or be given an opportunity
for demolishing his views.</p>

<p>“I think I had rather not inflict my trivialities upon
you at all, sir,” he remarked, with truth, and yet
with an absence of sincerity of which he felt that
Lucilla, at all events, was quite as well aware as he
was himself.</p>

<p>“I assure you that I’m not worth reading.”</p>

<p>“I shall judge of that for myself,” said the Canon
kindly. “Was there not something in that Review that
was sent to you, Flora?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Flora unwillingly.</p>

<p>“Fetch it, my dear.”</p>

<p>Quentillian cast his mind over his more recent productions,
and was invaded by a grim dismay.</p>

<p>His opinion of the Canon’s literary judgment, where
writings not directly connected with Church matters
were concerned, was of the slightest, but he disliked
the thought both of the pain that the elder man would
feel in reading that which would offend his taste, and
of the remonstrance that he would certainly believe it
his duty to make.</p>

<p>It was a relief to him when Flora returned without
the Review, and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“There is someone who wants to speak to you in
the hall, Father. I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p>The Canon rose at once.</p>

<p>“‘The man who wants me is the man I want’,” he
quoted, and left the room.</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind him, Flora said to
her sister, with a certain ruthless disregard of Quentillian’s
presence that at least established the earnestness
of her concern:</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Lucilla laconically.</p>

<p>“But we can’t let him see that Review. Adrian sent
it to me—it’s got something in it by that man Hale.
Father would hate the whole thing.”</p>

<p>Lucilla looked at Quentillian.</p>

<p>“He won’t like my article, and I should very much
prefer him not to read it,” said the author candidly.</p>

<p>She smiled slightly.</p>

<p>“It’s the one on the Myth of Self-Sacrifice?”</p>

<p>Owen nodded.</p>

<p>“It might have been worse,” said Lucilla. “It might
have been the one in which you said that the parental
instinct was only another name for the possessive instinct.
And now I come to think of it, that one was
called The Sanctification of Domestic Tyranny, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“It was,” said Quentillian, in a tone which struck
himself as being rather that of a defiant child to its
nurse.</p>

<p>“Well, Father would have liked that even less than
the Myth of Self-Sacrifice, I imagine.”</p>

<p>She spoke without acrimony, without, in fact, any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
effect at all of personal bias, but Quentillian said dispassionately:</p>

<p>“You dislike the modern school of thought of which
my writings are a feeble example. May I ask why you
read them?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t dislike it, Owen,” she returned with
a calm at least equal to his own. “As for what you
write, I think you’re very often mistaken, but that
doesn’t prevent my being interested.”</p>

<p>Quentillian was slightly taken aback at being considered
mistaken, and still more at being told so. He
had always respected Lucilla, both morally and intellectually,
and he would have preferred to suppose the admiration
mutual.</p>

<p>“Owen, haven’t you got anything else that he could
have to read?” broke in Flora.</p>

<p>“Nothing that he would—care for,” answered Quentillian,
who had very nearly said “Nothing that he
would understand.”</p>

<p>“Father has asked for the Review, Flossie, and you’d
better get it. You needn’t work yourself up about
it. He knows its general character quite as well as
you do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he ought to be allowed to make himself
needlessly unhappy,” said Flora obstinately.</p>

<p>“You can’t prevent it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it would be wrong to say that I don’t
know where the Review is?”</p>

<p>“It would be foolish, which is worse,” said Lucilla
curtly. Her un-moral pronouncement closed the discussion.</p>

<p>Flora, looking grave and unhappy, left the room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
and presently returned with the instrument of destruction,
as she evidently regarded the production.</p>

<p>“Let us hope that Canon Morchard will continue to
be detained,” said Quentillian, not altogether ironically.</p>

<p>Flora made no reply.</p>

<p>In less than a quarter of an hour’s time, the Canon
came back again, picked up the Review and made a
careful scrutiny of the table of contents.</p>

<p>“The <i>Myth</i> of Self-Sacrifice?” he enunciated, with
a strongly-enquiring inflexion in his tone, as though
prepared to receive the writer’s instant assurance that
he was not responsible for so strange a heading.</p>

<p>Owen desired to leave the room, but was mysteriously
compelled to remain in it, glancing at intervals at
the all-too expressive face of his reader.</p>

<p>The Canon read very attentively, pausing every now
and then to turn back a page or two, as though comparing
inconsistencies of text, and sometimes also turning
on a page or two ahead, as if desirous of establishing
the certainty that a conclusion was eventually to be
attained. His eyebrows worked as he read, after a
fashion habitual with him.</p>

<p>There had been evenings when Flora had made the
slightest of pencil sketches, hardly caricaturing, but embodying,
this peculiarity, for her father’s subsequent
indulgent amusement. But no such artistic pleasantry
was undertaken tonight. The atmosphere did not lend
itself to pleasantry of any kind.</p>

<p>At last the Canon closed the volume, laid it down,
and removed his glasses with some deliberation.</p>

<p>“Dear lad, I am disappointed.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid you would be.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“Is this quite worthy of you?”</p>

<p>Owen felt that a reply either in the affirmative or in
the negative, would be equally unsatisfactory, and made
none.</p>

<p>“You have adopted the tone of the day to an extent
for which I was by no means prepared,” the Canon
said gently. “I am sorry for it, Owen—very sorry. I
think you have heard me speak before of my dislike
for the modern note, that emphasises the material
aspect, that miscalls ugliness realism, and coarseness
strength. Forgive me, dear Owen, if I hurt you, but
this—this trivial flippancy of yours, has hurt <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>Owen had no doubt that Canon Morchard spoke the
truth.</p>

<p>“How emphatically he belongs to the generation that
took the errors of other people to heart,” Quentillian
reflected.</p>

<p>He felt no great sympathy with such vicarious distresses.</p>

<p>“There is so much that is sad and bad in life, that
one longs to read of happiness, and hope, and beauty,”
said the Canon. “Why not, dear Owen, seek out and
write of the ‘something afar from the sphere of our
sorrow’?”</p>

<p>“Because to my way of thinking, only first-hand impressions
are of any value. The only value that any
point of view of mine can lay claim to, must lie in its
sincerity.”</p>

<p>“Words, words! You delude yourself with many
words,” said the Canon sadly, rousing in Quentillian
a strong desire to retort with the obvious <i>tu quoque</i>.</p>

<p>“Do not misunderstand me, dear fellow—there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
talent there—perversely exercised, if you will, but talent.
I cannot but believe that life has many lessons
in store for you, and when you have learnt them, then
you will write more kindly of human nature, more
reverently of Divine.”</p>

<p>Hope was once more discernible in the Canon’s voice
and on his face, and as he rose he laid his hand affectionately
upon the young man’s arm. “Hoping all
things—believing all things,” he murmured, as he left
the room.</p>

<p>Quentillian was left to the certainty that his brief
exposition of his literary <i>credo</i> had entirely failed to
convey any meaning to the Canon, and that the long
list of the Canon’s optimistic articles of faith now included
his own regeneration.</p>


<h3>(v)</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Father</span>, I think Flora looks ill.”</p>

<p>Canon Morchard gazed with concern at Lucilla as
she made the announcement, and at once devoted himself
to the anxious analysis that he always accorded
to any problem affecting one of his children.</p>

<p>“I have thought her altered myself, by the great grief
of last year. Spiritually, it has developed her, I believe.
But there is a sustained melancholy about her,
an absence of all hopeful reaction such as one looks for
from youth, that is certainly not wholly natural. You,
too, have observed it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Lucilla had observed a great deal more besides, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
she was at a loss for a definition of her secret, latent
fears.</p>

<p>“Flossie has become very irritable,” she said at last,
voicing the least of her anxieties.</p>

<p>“My dear, is that perfectly kind? Flora has had
much to try her, and your own absence in Canada
threw a great deal for which she is scarcely fitted, upon
her shoulders. I do so want you to overcome that
<i>critical</i> spirit of yours, dear Lucilla. It has very often
disturbed me.”</p>

<p>Lucilla thought for a moment, and decided, without
resentment as without surprise, that it would be of no
use to say that her observation had not contained any
of the spirit of criticism at all. She said instead:</p>

<p>“She doesn’t sleep well, and she is always up very
early.”</p>

<p>“She is always at the early Celebration, dear child,”
said the Canon tenderly. “Our Flora’s religion is a
very living reality to her—more so than ever, of late, I
think.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity that it should make her unhappy, instead
of happy.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying, Lucilla?” the Canon enquired
in highly-displeased accents.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly true. She is very restless, and very
unhappy, and the more she goes to church, the less
it seems to satisfy her.”</p>

<p>“And who are you, to judge thus of another’s spiritual
experiences? You mean well, Lucilla, but there
is a materialism about your point of view that has
long made me uneasy—exceedingly uneasy. You were
encumbered with household cares very young, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
has given you the spirit of Martha, rather than the
spirit of Mary. Leave Flora to my direction, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“I should like her to see the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Has she complained of ill-health?”</p>

<p>“No, not at all. She resents being asked if she is
well.”</p>

<p>“Most naturally. She is not a child. You take too
much upon yourself, Lucilla, as I have told you before.
Leave Flora’s welfare in Higher hands than
ours, and remember that it is not the part of a Christian
to anticipate trouble. Where is your faith?”</p>

<p>Lucilla was not unaccustomed to this enquiry, and
did not deem any specific reply to be necessary. Whatever
the whereabouts of that which the Canon termed
her faith, it did not serve in any way to allay her
anxiety.</p>

<p>She watched Flora day by day.</p>

<p>She saw her increasing pallor, her gradual loss of
weight, the black lines that deepened beneath her eyes.
Above all, she saw the mysterious sense of grievance,
that most salient characteristic of the neurotic, gather
round her sister’s spirit.</p>

<p>After a little while, she ceased to talk of her visit
to Canada, of Valeria, and Valeria’s children, because
she saw that Flora could not bear these subjects.</p>

<p>“She’s <i>jealous</i>,” thought Lucilla, with a sick pang
of pity.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for poor Val, living right away from civilization,
and absorbed by commonplace things all the
time,” said Flora.</p>

<p>She went to church more frequently than ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>Lucilla wondered very often if anything had happened
while she was away.</p>

<p>One day she asked Owen Quentillian.</p>

<p>“There was the shock of David’s death,” he said
rather lamely.</p>

<p>“Yes. Father says it affected Flora terribly for a
long while.”</p>

<p>“Do you find her much changed, then?”</p>

<p>“I find her very unbalanced,” said Lucilla with her
usual directness.</p>

<p>“I think she <i>is</i> an unbalanced person,” Quentillian
assented, levelly.</p>

<p>“I wish she could leave home for a time.”</p>

<p>But Flora, when this was suggested to her, said that
she did not wish to leave home. Her manner implied
that the suggestion hurt her.</p>

<p>At first the Canon was pleased, assuring Lucilla that
the pleasant home-life at St. Gwenllian, even if robbed
of its old-time joyousness, would best restore Flora
to herself. But after a time, he, too, watched her with
anxiety.</p>

<p>“Little Flora is not herself,” he began to say.</p>

<p>“Let me send for the doctor, Father,” Lucilla urged.</p>

<p>“We will see, my dear, later on. The unsettled
weather is trying to us all just now—no doubt things
will right themselves in a day or two, and we shall smile
at our own foolish, faithless fears.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, no one at St. Gwenllian evinced
any desire to smile at anything, and Flora became subject
to violent fits of crying.</p>

<p>Her dignity and her delicate reticence seemed alike
to have deserted her. She cried in church, and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
she cried at home, regardless of the presence of
her father and sister.</p>

<p>“My dear, what is it?” the Canon enquired at last,
long after Lucilla had given up asking the same question
in despair.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“It is not right to prolong your sorrow for your
dear one in this fashion,” said the Canon. “Can we
not trust dear David to the Everlasting Arms, and fulfil
our own appointed days here below?”</p>

<p>His daughter made no reply.</p>

<p>“This is reaction, Flora,” said Canon Morchard decisively.
“When this heavy blow first fell upon us,
you were my courageous daughter, my comforter—so
far as that was humanly possible. Do not falter
now—remember that whom He loveth, He chastizeth.”</p>

<p>“I do remember,” she said, her face a mask of misery.</p>

<p>“You are not well,” said the Canon tenderly. “I
shall no longer allow you to exert yourself as you have
been doing. Lucilla here will arrange that your class
shall be temporarily given over to other management,
and no doubt she can herself arrange to replace you
at the choir-practices.”</p>

<p>“I can arrange it,” Lucilla said, “but——”</p>

<p>She looked at her sister.</p>

<p>Flora broke into a tempest of tears.</p>

<p>“Don’t take away what work I <i>can</i> do,” she sobbed
out. “My life is useless enough, in all conscience.”</p>

<p>“Flora!” the Canon thundered. “Have a care! Such
a thought is perilously near to being a blasphemous
one.”</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“You are unstrung, my poor child,” said her father.
He took to treating her almost as an invalid, and
failed to perceive that his watchful and incessant solicitude
produced upon Flora’s nerves an effect that was
the very reverse of soothing.</p>

<p>“She ought to go right away from home,” said
Lucilla to Quentillian. “But it’s difficult to suggest it
again, she was so much upset when I spoke of it before.
Will you try what you can do, Owen? She
is a great deal more likely to listen to someone who is
not one of the family. It’s one of the symptoms.”</p>

<p>“Symptoms of what?”</p>

<p>“Of hysteria,” said Lucilla succinctly, facing the
word as she had already faced the fact.</p>

<p>Quentillian admired her directness, but it did not
breed in him any desire to adopt the measure suggested,
and speak to Flora.</p>

<p>At last, however, he did so. They had scarcely been
alone together since the day when she had told him
of her visit to Mrs. Carey.</p>

<p>“Is that business on your mind, Flora?”</p>

<p>He had thought for some time that it might be.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carey, I mean.”</p>

<p>She coloured deeply.</p>

<p>“I did what I thought right at the time, Owen. Is
there any necessity to discuss it again?”</p>

<p>“Not if you don’t wish to, certainly. I had an idea
that it might be a relief. I suppose no one knows besides
ourselves?”</p>

<p>“No one. She never wrote to me, you know, and
I feel sure she never will. She was the sort of person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
to be thoroughly absorbed by her impressions of the
moment. I sometimes wonder what happened to her,
in Scotland.”</p>

<p>“It is not very difficult to guess what <i>will</i> happen,
sooner or later, from what you told me. People like
Mrs. Carey live from one emotional crisis to another.”</p>

<p>She gave him a curious look.</p>

<p>“At least it’s living—not stagnation. That interview
with Mrs. Carey seems like a dream, almost, nowadays—something
quite apart from the rest of my life.
I suppose it’s because it’s the only thing I’ve ever done
entirely by myself, without any of the family knowing
about it. I’ve never even seen anyone else at all like
Mrs. Carey—it was impossible to get into touch with
her, really. She was like a painted cardboard figure,
with no back to it—nothing solid.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve turned down that page, now—it’s finished
with?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, looking down.</p>

<p>He had wondered whether that which he sometimes
thought of as Flora’s Jesuitical plotting had come to
prey upon her mind.</p>

<p>Evidently, if it did, he was not to be told so.</p>

<p>In the end he could think of no more subtle enquiry
than:</p>

<p>“Why are you unhappy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said with a trembling lip.</p>

<p>“I feel I’m of no use in the world. Wouldn’t you be
unhappy, if you felt like that—that nobody really
needed you in any way, and you had nothing to do?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” said Quentillian reflectively. “I
am quite sure that nobody does need me, and it doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
distress me. As for having nothing to do, I imagine—if
you will forgive me for saying so—that one can always
find something if one looks far enough.”</p>

<p>“It’s different for a man.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>Quentillian went away still undetermined whether
Flora’s conduct of the <i>affaire</i> Carey was the cause or
the result of her present deplorable condition.</p>

<p>That she had all the makings of a fanatic, he had
long suspected, and the Canon’s determination to treat
her as an invalid, in need of rest and complete inaction,
seemed to him to be a singularly ill-advised one.</p>

<p>In spite of his disapproval of her methods, Quentillian
had come to feel a certain affection for Flora,
and he could not avoid a sense of complicity that drew
him to her, even while it chafed his self-righteousness.</p>

<p>With an entire lack of originality, he informed
Lucilla that he thought her sister would be better away
from home.</p>

<p>“Well, so do I. But even to go away for a few weeks
would only be a half-measure. Owen, I’m frightened
about Flora—far more than I’ve ever been about anyone
before.”</p>

<p>He could partly apprehend her meaning.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that perhaps this—phase—is only
another manifestation of the same spirit that made
Val want to go and work somewhere?”</p>

<p>“In a sense, yes. You see, all the intellectual interests,
and the mental appreciations, to which we were
brought up, although those things did fill our days—at
least before the war—were only superimposed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
what Val and Flossie and Adrian really were, in themselves.
Not essentials, I mean, to either of them.”</p>

<p>Quentillian wondered what Lucilla’s own essentials
might be. She had given him no hint of them, ever,
and yet he suspected her of an almost aggressive neutrality
with regard to the imposed interests of which
she had spoken.</p>

<p>The odd contradiction in terms seemed to him expressive
of the difference that he felt certain existed between
Lucilla’s daily life, and the personal, intimate
standpoint from which she all the time regarded that
life.</p>

<p>Something of the same ruthlessness of purpose that
had once characterized Flora, he had always discerned
in Lucilla, but he felt very certain that her essential
sanity and humour would have kept her forever from
the strange and tortuous means adopted by Flora to
safeguard those interests of which she apparently felt
herself to be a better judge than her Creator.</p>

<p>Lucilla would neither juggle with fate, nor see any
justification for tampering with other people’s correspondence.</p>

<p>“Flora thinks, now, that she doesn’t want to go away
from home.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity, perhaps, that she didn’t go to Canada
instead of you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you see Father didn’t really want either
of us to go, and Flossie wouldn’t have disobeyed him.”</p>

<p>Flora’s conscience! Owen felt as impatient at the
thought of it, as he had frequently felt before. He had,
however, long ago sufficiently assimilated the atmosphere
of St. Gwenllian to refrain from pointing out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
that Flora had been for some years of an age to act
for herself, independently of the parental sanction. He
did not, indeed, suppose that Lucilla needed to have
anything so self-evident put before her.</p>

<p>“Do you think Flora would consent to see a doctor?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Miss Morchard’s unvarnished No-es and Yes-es always
took him slightly by surprise, especially after
any time spent with the Canon.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said Lucilla vigorously, “that Flora
needs something to occupy her mind. She is preying
on herself, and unless something happens to take her
out of herself, Owen, I think she will go mad.”</p>

<p>He instinctively paid the homage due to her habitual
precision of expression, by taking the startling phrase
literally.</p>

<p>“Have you told anyone?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“But you must. If you really think that, you must
tell the Canon so.”</p>

<p>“I know.” Her voice was rather faint, but she repeated,
more strongly and with entire acceptance in
her voice, “I know I must.”</p>

<p>It reminded him of the long past days when one of
the St. Gwenllian children had been naughty, and the
task of taking the culprit before the Canon had invariably,
and as a matter of course, devolved upon
Lucilla.</p>


<h3>(vi)</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Flora</span> is treading the thorny way that saints have
trodden. If your own spirituality, which is in its infancy—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
its cradle, I may say—does not enable you
to understand that <i>via dolorosa</i>, at least refrain from
trivial interpolations and misrepresentations, Lucilla, I
beg.”</p>

<p>Canon Morchard’s tone rather suggested commanding,
than begging, and his large eyes seemed to flash
with indignation as they looked, from beneath corrugated
brows, at Lucilla.</p>

<p>She was rather paler than her usually colourless
wont.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that Flora is suffering from a very
common form of hysteria, father, and I thoroughly
distrust any inspiration of hers in her present state
of health.”</p>

<p>“She has told me herself that she is in her usual
health, and that she positively objects to the idea
of seeing a medical man. I see no reason for disbelieving
her own statement.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do.”</p>

<p>“Lucilla, you forget yourself.”</p>

<p>Lucilla and the Canon looked at one another, each
seeming momentarily to despair of the other.</p>

<p>At last Lucilla said:</p>

<p>“A little time ago, you thought she was ill, too.”</p>

<p>“Mind and body react upon one another, no doubt,
and our little Flora is highly strung. I do not recognize
it as being in any way incumbent upon me to explain
to you my treatment of any soul in my charge,
Lucilla, but I may say that I have now come to the
conclusion that Flora’s malady was of the soul. With
that, you must rest content.”</p>

<p>Lucilla did not rest content at all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>A philosophical acceptance of the inevitable had
long been part of Miss Morchard’s life, but in the
weeks that followed she came nearer to the futility
of the spoken protest than ever before.</p>

<p>From seemingly eternal weeping, however, Flora
presently passed to a tense exaltation of spirit that
found its culmination in long hours spent upon her
knees.</p>

<p>Lucilla made only one appeal to her.</p>

<p>“Flossie, won’t you tell me what’s happening? I
can’t help knowing that you’ve been very unhappy.”</p>

<p>“I’m not unhappy now,” said Flora quickly. “At
least, not like I was before. You know I’ve put myself
absolutely under father’s direction, Lucilla? How
wonderful he is!”</p>

<p>“He has made you happier?”</p>

<p>“Not he himself. He has shown me where to find
peace, at last.”</p>

<p>“If you mean Church, I should have thought you’d
known about it ever since you were born, very nearly.”</p>

<p>If the faint hint of impatient derision latent in her
sister’s tone was perceptible to Flora, she showed no
resentment at it.</p>

<p>She flushed deeply and looked earnestly at Lucilla.</p>

<p>“I wish I could make you understand. But some
things are too sacred to be described, even if one could.
The only thing I can say is that I was unhappy, I felt
I was wasting my life, and that nobody cared. And
I was full of remorse for a wrong I had done. I can’t
tell you what it was, Lucilla, nor anyone else, ever,
and I can’t undo it, now, but at least I can expiate it,
and all my other failings.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“Expiation?” Lucilla spoke the word unenthusiastically.
“But if you can’t undo whatever it was you did—and
really, Flossie, I can’t believe it was anything
so very desperate—will it be a good plan to go on being
miserable about it for the rest of your life, all to no
purpose?”</p>

<p>“‘The heart knoweth its own bitterness,’” Flora
replied gently.</p>

<p>Lucilla was left to apply the truth of the adage to
her own condition of mind.</p>

<p>She was very unhappy about her sister.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Flora had ceased to weep, and although
she ate less than ever and rose early for the purpose of
going to church, she looked rather less ill. Only the
strained look in her eyes remained, ever increasing, to
justify Lucilla’s feeling of sick dismay.</p>

<p>That it was entirely unshared by Canon Morchard,
she knew already, but she was not altogether prepared
for the announcement that he presently made.</p>

<p>“I am very happy about dear Flora—peculiarly
and wonderfully so. What think you, Lucilla, of this?
Flora is turning her thoughts towards the Sisterhood
at St. Marychurch.”</p>

<p>It was never Miss Morchard’s way to respond over-emphatically
to an invitation from her father to state
her thoughts freely, experience having long since taught
her what a tangled web we weave when first we practice
speaking the truth inopportunely.</p>

<p>“Has she only just started the idea?”</p>

<p>“Nay, she tells me—and I can readily believe it—that
the grace of God, according to its mysterious
wont, has been working within her for a long while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
now. There has been a period of darkness for Flora,
undoubtedly, but she is emerging more and more into
the light—that light that shineth into the Perfect Day!”</p>

<p>The Canon seemed rather inclined to forget himself
in profound musings.</p>

<p>“It implies losing her,” said Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Humanly speaking, yes, and it is hard to eradicate
the human element. But once that is done—and done
it <i>shall</i> be—what remains is altogether joyful. I shall
see her go, if go she does, with feelings far other than
those with which I saw our poor Valeria leave home!”</p>

<p>Lucilla thought so, too, and would emphatically have
given the preference to Valeria’s method of inaugurating
an independent career.</p>

<p>“I <i>cannot</i> be anything but glad that one of mine
should be dedicated!” the Canon exclaimed, as though
the exclamation broke from him almost irrepressibly.</p>

<p>“But does Flora mean to go away at once?”</p>

<p>“She wishes it greatly, and I should hardly feel
justified in restraining her. Flora is not a child, and
her own desire, as she says herself, is to feel that wayward,
wayless will of hers at safe anchorage at last.
Dear child, her one regret is for me.”</p>

<p>Tears stood in the Canon’s eyes.</p>

<p>“The grief of last winter greatly developed Flora,
I believe. There has been a tendency to dreaminess,
to a too great absorption in her music, that I confess
has made me anxious in the past. But she speaks most
rightly and nobly of her certainty that a call has come
to her, and if so, it is indeed a vocation that must
not be gainsayed. She is all ardour and anxiety to
begin, and if all is well, she and I go to St. Marychurch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
to view the establishment there next week, and enter
into the necessary arrangements.”</p>

<p>“What sort of life will it mean for her?”</p>

<p>“One of direct service, dear Lucilla, of shelter from
the temptations of this world, of close personal union
with Christ Himself, I trust. All indeed are not called
to such union, but I believe with all my heart that our
Flora is amongst the chosen few, and grievous though
it be to lose her from our sadly diminished home-circle,
I cannot but rejoice for her, and with her.”</p>

<p>The Canon’s voice trembled very much as he spoke,
but his smile was one of single-hearted sincerity.</p>

<p>“But <i>does</i> she rejoice?” said Lucilla rather faintly.</p>

<p>“Indeed she does. I confess that Flora’s earnest
desire for self-immolation, her ardent spirit, have taken
me by surprise. She is of the stuff of which the
martyrs were made. No austerity has any terrors for
her—she is already far advanced upon the way of the
mystic.”</p>

<p>Lucilla wrung her hands together.</p>

<p>“What is it, my dear one?” said her father gently.</p>

<p>She could not tell him. She felt unable to voice the
terror and the profound distrust that possessed her at
the thought of Flora, fanatically eager for discipline
of her own seeking, finding in religious emotionalism
an outlet for instincts that she had not dared, so far as
Lucilla could judge, to call by their right name.</p>

<p>“One can only let other people go their own way,
then?” she murmured, more to herself than to the
Canon.</p>

<p>“Say, rather, the way appointed for them, dear
Lucilla. Yours and mine may lie together yet awhile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
longer, I trust, but I am no longer young, and these
repeated partings tell upon me. It is a sacrifice for
you, too, to make, but let us do so cheerfully—aye,
and right thankfully, too. Our little one has been
chosen for the Bride of Heaven, as the beautiful old
devotional phrase has it.”</p>

<p>Lucilla was only too conscious that the beautiful
old devotional phrase awoke nothing in herself but
a shuddering distaste.</p>

<p>She could not doubt, however, that its effect upon
Flora was far otherwise.</p>

<p>Although she saw, as time went by, that no outside
influence would have power to shatter the vision
so clearly before the Canon’s eyes and to which he so
unfalteringly directed Flora’s gaze, it brought to her
a slight sense of personal relief when the Canon, after
inditing a letter of his usual unbridled length and
meticulous candour, informed her that he had besought
Quentillian to spend at St. Gwenllian that which he
emphasized as Flora’s last evening at home.</p>

<p>“It will make it easier for us all, to have that dearest
of dear fellows amongst us. He is so truly one of ourselves,
and yet the mere presence of someone who
does not always form part of our familiar little circle,
will prevent overmuch dwelling upon the tender associations
of the past that are well-nigh beyond bearing,
at such a time as this.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Owen, laconic as Lucilla herself, made no attempt to
conceal either his personal dislike of the solution to
Flora’s problem, or his innate conviction of her complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
right to any form of self-slaughter that she might
select.</p>

<p>They exchanged no opinions, but he found occasion
to say to her in private:</p>

<p>“One thing, Flora. Will you leave me to deal with
the Mrs. Carey equation, if it ever comes to be necessary?”</p>

<p>“I hope it never will.”</p>

<p>“So do I. But make it your legacy to me, so that if
ever it has to be thought of again, I may do as seems
best to me.”</p>

<p>Flora smiled, her shadowy, tremulous smile.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you do that anyway?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should. But I would rather have your
permission. And after all, you know, Flora—you
won’t be able to pull strings from your Sisterhood.”</p>

<p>It was the last, almost the only, reference that he
would permit himself, and both could smile at it
faintly.</p>

<p>“Very well, Owen. I don’t want to remember it
ever again, and I shall only think of Mrs. Carey now
in one way.”</p>

<p>She lacked the Canon’s capacity for outward expression,
even now, and her colour rose as she spoke.</p>

<p>Only in earnest and uncondemnatory intercession
would Mrs. Carey find place again in Flora’s thoughts.</p>

<p>Owen knew it as well as though she had told him
so.</p>

<p>The evening was mild and beautiful, and the Canon
sat at the open window, leaning back as though greatly
fatigued, and asked Flora for some music.</p>

<p>“Shall I sing?” she asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“Are you able to, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” she said earnestly, and Quentillian
could surmise that she was instinctively eager for the
form of self-expression most natural to her, as a vent
for her own mingled emotions.</p>

<p>Her voice was more beautiful than ever, with a
depth of feeling new to it.</p>

<p>Quentillian was indignant with himself when he
found that this perfectly traditional setting for a
pathetic situation was unmistakably affecting him.</p>

<p>The only light round them was that of the summer’s
evening, and Flora’s voice came with strength and
sweetness and purity from her scarcely-seen figure at
the far end of the room, in well-remembered and intrinsically-exquisite
melody. She was part of his childhood—she
was going away—they would none of them
ever again see Flora, as they had known her, any
more....</p>

<p>Quentillian, in a violent endeavour to react from
an emotion that he unsparingly qualified as blatant,
turned his eyes away from the singer.</p>

<p>He looked at Lucilla, and saw that she sat very still.
He reflected that for a face so sensitive, and possessed
of so much latent humour, hers was singularly inexpressive
of anything but acceptance. Nevertheless it
was an acceptance that had its origin, most unmistakably,
in a self-control acquired long since, rather than
in an absence of any capacity for strong feeling.</p>

<p>He wondered, not for the first time, what her life
had taught Lucilla.</p>

<p>He looked at Canon Morchard.</p>

<p>The Canon had closed his eyes and his face, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
which the lines were showing heavily at last, was white
with the grey pallor of age. Nevertheless he, too,
showed the deep, essential placidity of a conscious acceptance,
and for the first time Quentillian perceived a
fundamental resemblance between the Canon and his
eldest daughter.</p>

<p>As though aware of the scrutiny fixed upon him, the
Canon opened his eyes, and smiled as they met Quentillian’s.</p>

<p>“That harmony will be lost to us for a time, perhaps,”
he said softly. “But is it not a foretaste of
that great Song of Praise that will have no ending, and
in which all, all, will be able to join together? I
think so, Owen.”</p>

<p>He turned his head slightly, his finger-tips joined
together in the position habitual to him.</p>

<p>“Flora, my child, my dear daughter, will it be too
much if I ask for ‘Lead, Kindly Light,’ as you have
so often given it to us on long-ago Sundays when we
have been all together—all together?”</p>

<p>For answer, she struck the opening chords very
gently.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom</div>
<div class="indent">“Lead thou me on</div>
<div class="verse">“The night is dark, and I am far from home</div>
<div class="indent">“Lead thou me on ...</div>
<div class="indent3">.... “Till, the night is gone</div>
<div class="verse">“And with the morn those Angel faces smile</div>
<div class="verse">“Which I have loved long since and lost awhile.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Flora’s voice was rapt and unfaltering.</p>

<p>Lucilla did not move, nor raise her eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>It was Owen Quentillian, poignantly and unwillingly
conscious of pathos, who set his teeth in a profound
and intense resentment at the obvious emotional appeal
that he found himself unable to ignore.</p>

<p>He unspeakably dreaded the breakdown of the
Canon’s composure that he foresaw, when Flora’s last
note had died away into silence.</p>

<p>He could not look up.</p>

<p>“Flora!”</p>

<p>The Canon’s voice was steady and gentle.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my child. Bid me good-night, and go,
now. You must have some rest, before your journey
tomorrow.”</p>

<p>She came to him and he blessed and kissed her as
usual, only letting his hand linger for a moment on
her head as he repeated as though speaking to himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And with the morn those Angel faces smile</div>
<div class="verse">“Which I have loved long since and lost awhile.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Good-night, Owen. Goodbye,” said Flora.</p>

<p>She left the room, and the Canon raised himself
with difficulty from his low chair and said:</p>

<p>“I have some preparations to make for tomorrow. I
will leave you for a little while.”</p>

<p>When he had gone, Owen felt the relaxation of his
own mental tension.</p>

<p>For the first time, and with a sincerity that left him
amazed, he found himself making use of the phrase
that from others had so often aroused rebellion in
himself:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“He is wonderful!”</p>

<p>Lucilla raised her eyes now, and looked full and
gravely at Quentillian.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m glad you see it at last, Owen.”</p>

<p>“At last?” he stammered, replying to her voice
rather than to her words.</p>

<p>“He is very fond of you. He has always been very
fond of you, ever since you were a little boy. And
it has—vexed me—very often, to see that you gave
him nothing in return, that, because he belongs to another
school, and another generation, you have almost
despised him, I think.”</p>

<p>Owen was conscious of colouring deeply in his sudden
surprise and humiliation.</p>

<p>“Although you are so clever, Owen,” she said in
the same grave, un-ironical tone, “it has seemed as
though you are not able, at all, to see beyond the surface.
I know that my father’s religious sentiment,
sentimentality even, his constant outward expression of
emotional piety, his guileless optimism, have all jarred
upon you. But you have had no eyes for his pathetic
courage, his constant striving for what he sees as the
highest.”</p>

<p>“Lucilla—in justice to myself—although what you
say may be true, if I have judged your father it has
been far more on account of his children—of what I
have seen of their lives.”</p>

<p>“You were not called upon to constitute yourself
the champion of his children. Valeria, even, had no
claim on your championship. It was not you whom
she loved, and you, too, tried to make Val what she
was never meant to be. When Val threw you over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
if my father tried to force upon you what you could
only see as the conventional <i>beau geste</i> of renunciation,
it was because he was incapable of believing that you
could have asked a woman to marry you without loving
her, body and soul. His forgiveness of Val,
whether you thought him entitled to forgive or not,
lay between him and her. And when you speak of our
lives, Owen, can’t you see that Val and Adrian and I,
and perhaps in a way even Flora, too, have come to
what we were meant for? No one can stand between
another soul, and life, really.”</p>

<p>He was oddly struck by the echo of words that he
had himself once used to Flora.</p>

<p>“You admit that he tried, to stand between you and
life?”</p>

<p>“I do,” she said instantly. “But if he had succeeded,
the fault would have been ours.”</p>

<p>She suddenly smiled.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it true that to face facts means freedom?
That’s why I’m not an optimist, Owen. I am willing
to face all the facts you like. But you, I think, in
judging my father, have only faced half of them.”</p>

<p>“You find me intolerant!” he exclaimed, half-ironically.
Never before had such an adjective been presented
to his strong sense of his own impartiality, his
detached rationalism.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. Only, I’m afraid—a little bit of a
prig.”</p>

<p>She uttered the strange, unimposing accusation, not
rudely, not unkindly, but almost mournfully.</p>

<p>“Christianity has been accused of intolerance very
often, and with only too much reason, but those outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
the Churches, who frankly claim to be agnostic,
often seem to me to be the most intolerant of all, of
what they look upon as superstition. Why should you
despise my father for beliefs that have led him to lead
an honourable life, and that have given him courage
to bear his many sorrows?”</p>

<p>“You have said, yourself, that the facing of facts
means freedom. I can see no freedom, and therefore
no beauty, in living in illusion.”</p>

<p>“Not for yourself, perhaps. Illusions could never
be anything but conscious, for you.”</p>

<p>“Nor for yourself, Lucilla,” he retorted swiftly.</p>

<p>“But how does that entitle us to despise another for
holding them?” she demanded, quite as swiftly. Nevertheless
Owen detected a lessening of severity, in so far
as she had coupled them together in her speech.</p>

<p>“Tonight,” he said gravely, “I admired your father
with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad.”</p>

<p>On the words, the same as those with which Lucilla
had begun their brief and rather amazing conversation,
the Canon returned into the room.</p>

<small>THE DEATH OF AN OPTIMIST</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>(i)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Quentillian’s</span> next and final summons to St.
Gwenllian came some months after Canon Morchard
had taken Flora to her Sisterhood, and returned alone.</p>

<p>Owen was unprepared for the change in the Canon’s
appearance, although he knew him to be ill.</p>

<p>“Aye, dear lad! It’s the last stage of the journey.
I have thought that it was so for some time, and they
tell me now that there is no doubt of it. This poor
clay is worn out, and the spirit within is to be set free.
Verily, I can still repeat those favourite words of mine:
‘All things work together for good, to those that love
God.’ If you but knew the number of times during
these last few years that I have cried out within myself
‘O for the wings of a dove, that I might fly away
and be at rest!’ And now it has come! and I hope to
keep my Christmas feast among the blest. They tell
me that it cannot be long.”</p>

<p>Quentillian looked the enquiry that he felt it difficult
to put into words.</p>

<p>“I can take very little. Soon, they tell me that even
that little will have become impossible. See how even
the crowning mercy of preparedness is vouchsafed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
me! I have put my house in order as well as may be,
and have no care save for my poor Lucilla. She will
be alone indeed, and it is for her sake, Owen, that I
want you to do a great kindness to a dying man.”</p>

<p>“Anything, sir. Do you want me to stay?”</p>

<p>“You have it, Owen.” The Canon laid his hand,
thin now to emaciation, upon Quentillian’s.</p>

<p>“Stay with us now until the end comes. It cannot
be far off. I have outlived my brothers, and Lucilla’s
remaining aunt is old and infirm. It is not fit, even
were it possible, that she should come here. She will
receive Lucilla most tenderly after I am gone—of that
I am assured. But there is no one to uphold her, to
spare her needless distress, when the time comes.”</p>

<p>“I will do everything that I can to help her.”</p>

<p>“I know it, dear fellow—I know it. Thank you
from the bottom of my heart. It seems natural to treat
you as a son.”</p>

<p>The Canon paused and looked wistfully at Quentillian
upon the word.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Adrian will come home. I have written
to him—a long letter. He need not be afraid of me.</p>

<p>“I have written to my three absent children: To
Valeria—my blessing for her little sons—I would have
given much to see them before going—aye, and their
mother, too, my merry Valeria, as I once called her!
I have missed Valeria’s laughter in this quiet house,
that was once full of merriment and children’s voices.</p>

<p>“And I have written to Flora, my Flora, who chose
the better part. May she indeed be blessed in her
choice—little Flora!”</p>

<p>He sank back, looking exhausted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“I will stay as long as you wish me to stay, and I
will do all that I can for Lucilla,” repeated Quentillian.</p>

<p>“I know it. The last anxiety has been allayed. Aye,
Owen, I have ceased to concern myself with these
things now, I hope. If Adrian comes to me, and if
Lucilla can count upon you as upon a brother, then I
am well satisfied indeed. My affairs are in good order,
I believe. My will is with my solicitors—Lucilla knows
the address. What there is, goes in equal shares to
Lucilla, Valeria, and Adrian. Flora has received her
portion already. My books, dear Owen, are yours.
All else—personal effects, manuscripts, and the rest—are
Lucilla’s. She has been my right hand. There
are mementos to Clover, to one or two old friends
and servants—nothing else. I have thought it well to
make Lucilla sole executrix—she has helped in all my
business for so long!</p>

<p>“So you see that my temporal concerns are over and
done with. In regard to the spiritual, I have had the
unutterable honour and pleasure of a visit from the
Bishop himself. He was all fatherly goodness and
kindness. The dear Clover is always at hand for reading,
and I can depend on him utterly for those last
commendations that are to smooth my way down the
Valley of the Shadow. There is nothing wanting.
And now you have come!”</p>

<p>The Canon’s wasted face was both radiant and
serene.</p>

<p>The grief that had so often shown there seemed to
have passed away, and Quentillian found it almost
incredible that he had ever seen the Canon angry, or
weighed down by a leaden depression of spirits.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“Is he really happy, all the time?” Quentillian asked
Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Yes, all the time. Even when he has pain. But
they say there won’t be any more pain, most likely,
now. He will just sink, gradually. If you knew how
very little he is living on, even now, you would be
surprised.”</p>

<p>“Are you doing the nursing?”</p>

<p>“He wants a trained nurse. One has been sent for.
He thinks that it will spare me,” said Lucilla, smiling
a little.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Owen saw how difficult
Lucilla found it to be so spared.</p>

<p>The nurse was an efficient and conscientious woman,
and the Canon quickly became dependent upon her. He
begged Owen to spend as much time as possible with
Lucilla, who remained downstairs, replying to the innumerable
letters and the enquirers who came to the
house.</p>

<p>She was now only with her father for a brief morning
visit, and the hour in the afternoon when the nurse
took her exercise out of doors. Very often Quentillian,
at the Canon’s request, was also with them then.</p>

<p>“Lucilla and I have long ago said our last words,
such as they are,” the Canon told him with a smile.
“We understand one another too well to need to be
left alone together.”</p>

<p>Time slipped by with monotonous regularity, the
changes in the Canon almost imperceptible to the onlookers.</p>

<p>Then, preceded only by a telegram, Adrian came
home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“My father isn’t really dying, is he?” he asked
piteously.</p>

<p>“He can’t take anything at all, now. It’s a question
almost of hours.”</p>

<p>Lucilla took him upstairs to where his father lay,
propped upon pillows, and they were left alone together.</p>

<p>“You know, it is very bad for Canon Morchard to
have any agitation,” the nurse anxiously pointed out
to Lucilla, when the interview had lasted a long while.</p>

<p>“Can it make any real difference?”</p>

<p>“It may reduce his strength more quickly.”</p>

<p>“He would say that it was worth it. He has not
seen this son for a long while.”</p>

<p>Lucilla kept the woman out of the room as long as it
was possible to do so.</p>

<p>At last Adrian came downstairs.</p>

<p>That evening the Canon said to Quentillian, with
tears in his eyes:</p>

<p>“Adrian has promised me to give up his work for
that man. Is it not wonderful, dear Owen? All, all
added unto me. If this pain of mine is to be the price
of my boy’s awaking to his own better nature, how
gladly shall I not pay it!”</p>

<p>It was the only time that Quentillian had ever heard
him allude to having suffered physical pain.</p>

<p>“I have not been so much at rest about Adrian since
he was a little boy,” said the Canon. “He was always
the most affectionate of them all. And he cried like
a little child, poor fellow, this afternoon, and voluntarily
passed me his promise to leave that man.”</p>

<p>Quentillian’s own involuntary distrust of the promise
given by a weak nature, under strong emotional stress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
was profound, but he gave no sign of it. It no longer
caused him any satisfaction to be aware of a deeper
insight in himself than in the Canon. He could not
share that guileless singleness of vision, and felt no
envy of it, and yet he paradoxically desired that it
should remain unimpaired.</p>

<p>He asked Lucilla if she knew of Adrian’s promise.</p>

<p>“He told me. He was crying when he came down.
He can’t believe even yet that father is dying, poor
Adrian! And yet he must believe it, really, to have
made that promise.”</p>

<p>“The Canon is so thankful for it.”</p>

<p>“I know. He wanted it more than anything in the
world. Everything has come to make it easy for him
to go, Owen.”</p>

<p>Something in her tone made him say gently:</p>

<p>“Poor Lucilla!”</p>

<p>“Even if the impression is only temporary with
Adrian, it will be a comfort to him afterwards. He is
very unhappy now, that there should have been any
estrangement between them.”</p>

<p>It was evident enough that Lucilla, also, had no great
reliance upon Adrian’s stability of purpose, although
his present reaction had brought such joy and comfort
to the dying man.</p>

<p>That night for the first time the Canon’s mind wandered.
He spoke of his children as though all were
once more of nursery age, and at home together.</p>

<p>“Little Adrian can take my hand, and then he can
keep up with the others. Less noise, my love—a little
less noise.... Valeria’s voice is too often raised,
too often raised—although I like its merry note, in fit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
and proper season. My merry Valeria! Now are we
ready? The sketch-book, Flora, the sketch-book....
I want to see that pretty attempt at the Church finished.”</p>

<p>Then he said with an apologetic note in his voice:</p>

<p>“Flora lacks perseverance, and is too easily discouraged,
but we hope that she may show great feeling for
art, by and bye. Lucilla’s <i>forte</i> lies in more practical
directions. She is my housekeeper—my right hand,
I often call her. Look, children, at that effect of sunlight
through the beech-leaves. Is it not wonderful?
Come, Adrian, my man—no lagging behind....”</p>

<p>Presently a puzzled, distressed look came over his
face and he asked: “Is not one missing? Is David
here?”</p>

<p>Lucilla bent over him to say, “Yes, father,” but the
distressed look still lingered.</p>

<p>“Where is David?” said the Canon. “Was there
not some sadness—some trouble between us? No—no—all
a dream.”</p>

<p>His face lightened again. “David is safe home. I
shall see David tonight.”</p>

<p>By and by he asked to be told the time.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock.</p>

<p>The Canon’s voice had become a weak whisper.</p>

<p>“I thought it was morning, and that I had them all
again—little children. Such trustful little hands lying
in mine ... and the children have grown up and
gone away.... No ... Lucilla, you are there,
are you not, my dear love? And Owen—Owen, that
was like a third son to me. My own sons are there,
too—David is safe home ... only a very little way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
on ... and Adrian, little Adrian—he promised
... ah, all things work together for good....”</p>

<p>His voice trailed thinly away into silence, his wan
face was smiling.</p>

<p>“He will sleep,” whispered the nurse, and her words
were verified almost instantly.</p>

<p>Owen took Lucilla away.</p>

<p>There was a strong sense upon him that the summons
would not be long delayed now.</p>

<p>Lucilla went downstairs and quietly opened the outer
door into the garden. They walked up and down
there, Owen watching the red spark waxing and waning
from his own cigar. The night was extraordinarily
still, the dark arch of the sky powdered with
stars.</p>

<p>Neither spoke directly of that which occupied their
minds most, but Quentillian said by and bye:</p>

<p>“Where shall you go, eventually?”</p>

<p>“Torquay, perhaps. There is an old aunt there—father’s
sister. I shall have just enough not to be
dependent upon her, even if I make my home with her.”</p>

<p>“Will that be congenial?”</p>

<p>Lucilla gave a little low, sad laugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s much alternative, is there?
This house, of course, goes to the next incumbent. If
Mr. Clover is appointed—and we very much hope that
he will be—he would probably buy a good deal of the
furniture (which is just as well, as it would certainly
drop to pieces if we tried to move it). I couldn’t
possibly afford to set up house for myself, in any case.
And I must have something to do. Aunt Mary would
find plenty for me to do.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“I daresay,” said Quentillian without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are thinking of my taking up an occupation
or a profession seriously, but you know, Owen,
it isn’t really a practical proposition, though one feels
as though it ought to be. Just think for a minute, and
tell me what I’m fit for—except perhaps being someone’s
housekeeper.”</p>

<p>“My dear Lucilla, with your education and the literary
training your father has given you, surely anyone
would be glad of your services.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I can’t write shorthand. My typing,
which I taught myself, isn’t nearly as good or as quick
as that of any little girl of sixteen who has learnt it
properly, and can probably use half a dozen different
makes of machine. I’ve never learnt office routine—filing,
indexing, bookkeeping, the use of a dictaphone.
I believe all those things are necessary nowadays. I
don’t suppose, if I did learn them all now, I should
ever be very good or very quick.”</p>

<p>“I’m not suggesting that you should become a City
clerk at forty shillings a week.”</p>

<p>“A private secretary, then? I can’t honestly see why
anyone should employ a woman with no experience,
when there are so many experts wanting work. Languages
might be an asset, but most people know
French. German isn’t likely to be wanted now, and I
don’t fancy there is any great demand for Latin or
Greek. Even for teaching, schools want diplomas and
certificates, besides proficiency in games.”</p>

<p>“But the higher professions are all open to women
of education nowadays,” he protested. “You’re not
restricted to the kitchen or the nursery.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Do you really think that I could work up, now,
for a stiff legal or medical examination, and pass it?”
she demanded with a sort of gentle irony. “You don’t
realize, Owen, that I’m nearly forty.”</p>

<p>He had not realized it, and it silenced him momentarily.</p>

<p>“I think my chances went by a long time ago,” said
Lucilla. “I’ve never told anyone about it, but I think
I’d like to tell you now, because I don’t want you to
think of me as a victim.”</p>

<p>Quentillian registered a silent mental appreciation
of a reason diametrically opposite to the reason for
which the majority of confidences are bestowed.</p>

<p>“Before Val and Flossie grew up, it was obvious
that I should stay at home and look after the house.
Besides, I liked doing it. My father was—and is—the
whole world to me. But there was a time, just
once, when Val grew up, and David had gone away,
when I wanted to go away, too. Of course I’m talking
of a good many years ago, and there weren’t so many
openings to choose from. But I wanted very much to
go to college. Father could just have managed it, without
being unfair to any of the others.”</p>

<p>“You told him, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I told him.”</p>

<p>“Would he not consent?” inquired Owen, as she
paused.</p>

<p>“He promised to consent if I still wished it, after
thinking it over.”</p>

<p>“But he persuaded you not to wish it any more?”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t that. It’s a little bit difficult to explain.
He did ask me what I should gain by it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
whether it wasn’t just restlessness and seeking a vocation
to which I was not called. You remember hearing
him say that about Val, too?”</p>

<p>“I remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was all. He didn’t say anything more.
Of course I knew he wouldn’t like my going away
from him, without being told. But it was I who decided
that it was an occasion for making what I’m
afraid I thought of as a sacrifice.”</p>

<p>She surprised him by a little laugh.</p>

<p>“You see, Owen, I think <i>now</i> that I was quite
wrong.”</p>

<p>“Quite wrong,” he echoed gravely.</p>

<p>“It was an odd, muddled sort of time for some years
after that. I suppose I was resenting my own decision,
and yet trying to buoy myself up all the time by thinking
of my own self-abnegation and generosity. It had
seemed rather a beautiful thing to do at the time—to
sacrifice my own life to my widowed father and my
motherless brothers and sisters. At first, I remember
thinking that there would be something almost sacred
about my everyday life at home.”</p>

<p>“When people begin to think that things are sacred
to them, it generally means that they’re afraid of facing
the truth about them.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. It was a long time before I told myself
the truth. But in the end I did, when I saw that no
one was likely to want to marry me, and that my life
was going to be exactly what I had decided to let it
be. And of course from the minute I faced it fair and
square—after the first—it all became a great deal
easier. Besides, there were compensations, really.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>He made a sound of interrogation.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s really a great thing to have a home. I’ve
always felt sorry for women who lived in their boxes,
and had nowhere of their own. And being mistress
of the house all these years—I’ve liked that, and been
fairly interested in it. And I’ve got imagination enough
to see that books, and music, and a garden, to anyone
brought up as we were especially, are quite important
items. You know, women who have a career don’t
generally get those other things thrown in as well,
unless they’re exceptionally fortunate.”</p>

<p>“You set them against independence and your own
freedom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t say that, but they <i>do</i> count,” she said steadily.
“If it comes to a question of relative values, of
course they take second place. But once I’d admitted
to myself, quite honestly, that I’d relinquished my
chance of the best things of all, then I could quite see
those other things as being intrinsically worth something—a
very good second best. They’re really only
unsatisfactory when one tries to think of them as substitutes.
Taken at their own value—well, I’ve found
them helpful, you know.”</p>

<p>There was a silence before she spoke again.</p>

<p>“Most of all, there was Father.”</p>

<p>“That relationship has been the biggest factor in
your life, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She paused, and then in a tone resolutely
matter-of-fact, said: “I think perhaps I won’t talk
about that now. But I know just as well as you do
that in the course of nature, those particular links can
only be expected to endure for a certain number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
years. They’re breaking now, for me, and it means
that part of my life goes too.”</p>

<p>He could not contradict her.</p>

<p>“Is Adrian any use?”</p>

<p>“Poor Adrian! He says now that he and I must
keep together, and make a home for one another. He
wants to comfort me, and he knows Father would be
glad; but you can see for yourself that it wouldn’t
be fair to take him at his word. Perhaps we may be
together for a little while—till things have worn off
a little bit, for him. Adrian is emotional, isn’t he? I
don’t know what he’ll do, eventually.”</p>

<p>The recollection of Adrian’s promise to the Canon,
that he would relinquish his work, was evidently not
a factor that Lucilla took into serious consideration.
By tacit agreement neither of them alluded to it.</p>

<p>“Valeria will hardly be able to come home, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It’s out of the question. She couldn’t
leave the two babies, nor very well bring them with
her.”</p>

<p>“Flora?”</p>

<p>Already, Owen realized with faint surprise, he had
come to remember Flora’s corporeal existence only by
an effort. He could scarcely feel her to be less separated
from the realities of life than one who had died
in youth, and been long forgotten.</p>

<p>Lucilla only shook her head.</p>

<p>“They are all gone. Whatever anyone may say,
Owen, they didn’t shirk their chances. They said Yes
to Life as they saw it.”</p>

<p>“Can you be glad of that?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Very glad. Even selfishly, I can be glad. Think
of three—unfulfilled—lives to be spent side by side,
held together by affection if you like, but fundamentally
built on an artificial basis! No, no”—her smile
held humour, rather than conscious valour, though
Owen saw it as valiant too—“I’m glad to have faced
my facts at last, though it ought to have been done
long ago, when I made my choice. I’m not optimistic
now, but I—I’m free.”</p>

<p>As they turned, at the end of the garden path, a
dark figure sped across the grass towards them.
Adrian’s voice reached them, low and urgent:</p>

<p>“Come!”</p>


<h3>(ii)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Canon lay back against his pillows and it did
not need the nurse’s gesture to Lucilla to tell them that
he was dying. His breath came loud and fast and his
eyes were closed.</p>

<p>Adrian had flung himself on his knees at the bedside
and was sobbing, his face hidden in his arms. Quentillian
stood beside Lucilla, who held her father’s hand
in hers.</p>

<p>“Is he conscious?” Lucilla asked.</p>

<p>The nurse shook her head.</p>

<p>“Can anything be done to make it easier?” Lucilla
said then.</p>

<p>“No, my dear. I’ve sent messages for the doctor
and Mr. Clover, but——”</p>

<p>Her face completed the sentence.</p>

<p>They remained motionless, Adrian’s irregular sobs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
and the Canon’s heavy breathing alone cutting intermittently
across the silence.</p>

<p>Quentillian never knew how long it was before
Canon Morchard opened his eyes and spoke, articulating
with great difficulty.</p>

<p>“All safe—all happy ... verily, <i>all</i> things work
together for good!”</p>

<p>He smiled, looking straight across at Owen Quentillian,
and suddenly said with great distinctness:</p>

<p>“<i>Mors janua vitæ!</i>”</p>

<p>Owen could hear the cry still, ringing through the
room, in the time of dumb struggle that followed.</p>

<p>It seemed a fitting epitome of the spirit that had
been Fenwick Morchard’s.</p>

<p>Just before the first hint of day dawned into the
room, Lucilla and the nurse laid back on to the pillows
the form that they had been supporting.</p>

<p>Adrian was crying and shivering like a child.</p>

<p>“Take him downstairs and give him something hot
to drink,” the nurse commanded Owen. “There’s a fire
in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>Quentillian looked at Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Please go,” she said.</p>

<p>He went downstairs with Adrian.</p>

<p>“If only I’d been better to him! He was awfully
good to me, really,” sobbed Adrian. “He used to
make an awful fuss of me when I was a little chap,
and I wasn’t half grateful enough—beast that I was!”</p>

<p>“Drink this.”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can. Try and be a man, Adrian,
for your sister’s sake.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“It’s worse for me than for any of them,” said
Adrian ingenuously, “because I’ve got things to be
remorseful about, and they haven’t. And now it’s too
late!”</p>

<p>“You were here in time,” said Quentillian, abominably
conscious, and resentful, of his own triteness.</p>

<p>“And I promised him I’d chuck my job. I think
it comforted him.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it did.”</p>

<p>“It was a sacrifice, in a way, to throw the whole
thing up, when I was doing well and keen on it, and
all that sort of thing; but I’m thankful now that I
did it. Perhaps it made up to—<i>him</i>—for my having
been such a hound, often and often.”</p>

<p>It was oddly evident that Adrian was torn between
genuine grief and shock and a latent desire to make
the most of his own former depravity.</p>

<p>“I daresay you’re thinking that having been through
the war and everything, I ought to be used to the sight
of death,” he said presently; “but it’s quite different
when it’s like this. One got sort of hardened there,
and everybody was running the same risk—oneself included.
But my father—why, it seems like the end
of everything, Owen. I must say, I think I’m a bit
young to have my home broken up like this, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Very young,” repeated Quentillian automatically,
and yet not altogether without significance.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what will happen, but of course Lucilla
and I have to leave St. Gwenllian. It’s hard on
her, too. I thought we ought to keep together, you
know, for a bit. It seems more natural. I shall have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
to look for a fresh job, and I don’t know what Hale
will say to my chucking him.”</p>

<p>Adrian was silent, obviously uneasy, and it was evident
enough that it was the strong revulsion from that
anxiety which prompted his next sudden outburst.</p>

<p>“I’m so awfully thankful that I had the strength to
make that promise about leaving Hale. It’ll always
be a comfort to me to feel that I made a sacrifice for
the dear old man, and that he—went—the happier for
it. Mind you, I don’t agree with him about Hale and
Hale’s crowd. Father had the old-fashioned ideas of
his generation, you know, and of course all progress
seemed a sort of vandalism to him. I daresay if he’d
ever met Hale he’d have had his eyes opened a bit,
and seen things quite differently. Hale was always
jolly decent about him, too—he’d read some of his
stuff, and had quite a sort of admiration for it, in a
way. Said it was reactionary, and all that, but perfectly
sound in its own way, you know—scholarly, and
all that kind of muck.”</p>

<p>“Have you written to Hale?”</p>

<p>“No. Of course, in a way it’s an awfully awkward
situation for me, having to tell him why I’m not coming
back to him, and so on. I thought I’d pop up
and see him as soon as it could be managed. Of course
there are arrangements to be made——”</p>

<p>The boy broke off, in a fresh access of bewilderment
and grief.</p>

<p>“I simply can’t realize he’s gone, Owen. I say—you
do think he was happy, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That promise of mine meant a lot to him. I’m so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
thankful that I’ve got that to remember. You might
say, in a way, considering how much he always thought
of us, that some of his children had rather let him
down, in a way. I mean, Lucilla and I were the only
two there, out of the five of us. Of course, David,
poor chap, had gone already, and Val and Flossie
couldn’t very well help themselves—and yet there it
was! Do you suppose that when he said—<i>that</i>—about
‘all safe, all happy’—he was thinking of us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“It’s a comfort to know his mind was at rest. He
wouldn’t have said that if I hadn’t made that promise,
you know,” said Adrian.</p>

<p>“Look here, Adrian, hadn’t you better try and get
some sleep? There’ll be things to be done, later, you
know, and you and I—if you’ll let me help—must try
and take some of it off Lucilla’s hands.”</p>

<p>All the child in Adrian responded to the transparent
lure.</p>

<p>He drew himself up.</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully, Owen. I shall be only too glad of
your help. There’ll be a good deal for me to see to,
of course, so perhaps I’d better lie down for an hour
or two while I can. What about Lucilla?”</p>

<p>“Would you like to come and find her?”</p>

<p>The boy shuddered violently.</p>

<p>“Not in there—I couldn’t,” he said piteously.</p>

<p>They went upstairs together.</p>

<p>As they passed the door of the Canon’s room, it was
cautiously opened and the nurse came outside and spoke
to Adrian.</p>

<p>“The doctor should be here presently. I want him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
to see Miss Morchard. She turned faint a little while
ago, and I’ve got her into her room, but I’m afraid
she’s in for a breakdown. I’ve seen them like this
before, after a long strain, you know.”</p>

<p>The woman’s tone was professionally matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>“Had I better go to her?” said Adrian, troubled, and
seeming rather resentful at the fresh anxiety thrust
upon him.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t, if I were you. It’ll only upset her.
She’s broken down a bit—hysterical. It’ll relieve her,
in the end. I shan’t leave her now, till the doctor
comes.”</p>

<p>Lucilla hysterical!</p>

<p>Owen, almost more amazed than concerned, watched
the nurse depart to what she evidently looked upon as
a fresh case.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t do anything, I suppose,” said Adrian
miserably.</p>

<p>“Go to bed,” Quentillian repeated. “Shall I draft
out some telegrams for you, and let you see them before
they go? It’s no use sending them to the post-office
before eight.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to sleep yourself?”</p>

<p>“Not just now, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll relieve you at seven. Send someone to
call me, will you?—though I don’t suppose I shall
sleep.”</p>

<p>The boy trailed into his room, disconsolate and
frightened-looking.</p>

<p>Owen Quentillian, searching for writing materials,
found them on the table in the Canon’s study, a table
scrupulous in its orderliness, each stack of papers docketed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
each article laid with symmetrical precision in its
own place.</p>

<p>Owen would not sit there, where only the Canon
had sat, under the crucifix mounted on the green velvet
plaque. He went instead to another, smaller table, in
the embrasure of a window, and sat there writing until
the morning light streamed in upon him.</p>

<p>Then he laid down the pen, with a sense of the futility
of activities that sought to cheat reflection, and
let his mind dwell upon that which subconsciously
obsessed it.</p>

<p>Canon Morchard had died as he had lived—an optimist.
An invincible faith in the ultimate rightness of
all things had been his to the end, and perhaps most
of all at the end.</p>

<p>Quentillian envisaged the Canon’s causes of thankfulness.</p>

<p>He had seen his children as “safe” and “happy.”
Was it only because he had wanted so to see them?</p>

<p>David, who was dead, had been mourned for, but
the Canon had been spared the deepest bitterness of
separation. He had known nothing of the gulf widening
between his own soul and that of his eldest
son....</p>

<p>A fool’s paradise?</p>

<p>He had seen Lucilla as safe and happy.</p>

<p>And yet Lucilla’s life was over, unlived. As she
herself had said, her chances had gone by. Torquay
remained. It was not very difficult to imagine her
days there. An old lady—the placid kindness accorded
by the aged to the middle-ageing—the outside interests
of a little music, a few books, a flower-garden—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
pathetic, vicarious planning for scarcely-seen nephews
and nieces—the quick, solitary walks, cut short by the
fear of being missed, and then, as years went on, more
solitude, and again more solitude.</p>

<p>Lucilla had said: “I’m not an optimist now—but I’m
free.”</p>

<p>From the bottom of his heart Owen recalled with
thankfulness the fact of Lucilla’s freed spirit.</p>

<p>It was the best that life would ever hold for her now.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned to Flora.</p>

<p>Quentillian could not envisage her life: eternally secluded,
eternally withdrawn. She was lost to them, as
they were lost to her.</p>

<p>Subconsciously, he was aware of associations connected
with Flora’s vocation upon which he preferred
not to dwell. He knew, dimly, intuitively, that Lucilla’s
merciless clarity of outlook had seen Flora less
as a voluntary sacrifice than as the self-deluded victim
of fanaticism.</p>

<p>But no doubts had crossed the Canon’s mind on
Flora’s behalf. He had known no distrust of her craving
for self-immolation, no dread of reaction coming
too late.</p>

<p>He had thanked God for the dedication of Flora.</p>

<p>The one of his children for whom he had grieved
perhaps longest was Valeria. And it was on Valeria
that Owen’s thoughts dwelt most gladly. She had purchased
reality for herself, and although the price might
include his own temporary discomfiture, Quentillian rejoiced
in it candidly. Nevertheless, it was Val’s error,
and not Val’s achievement, that her father had seen.
His hope for her had been the one of ultimate reparation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
implied in his own favourite words—“All things
work together for good.”</p>

<p>And the Canon had quoted those words yet again,
when Adrian, his favourite child, had come back to
him. His deepest thankfulness had been for the emotional,
unstable promise volunteered by Adrian’s impulsive
youth.</p>

<p>Quentillian could see no reliance to be placed upon
that promise to which the Canon, with such ardent
gratitude and joy, had trusted. Adrian would drift,
the type that does little harm, if less good. Strength
of intellect, as of character, had been denied him. No
interest would hold him long, no aim seem to him to be
worth sustained effort.</p>

<p>And yet the Canon had felt Adrian, too—perhaps
most of all Adrian, in the flush of reconciliation after
their estrangement—to be “safe” and “happy.”</p>

<p>Then optimism was merely a veil, drawn across the
nakedness of Truth?</p>

<p>From the depths of a profound and ingrained pessimism,
Quentillian sought to view the question dispassionately,
and felt himself fundamentally unable to
do so.</p>

<p>Hard facts and—at best—resignation, or baseless
hopes and undaunted courage, such as had been Canon
Morchard’s?</p>

<p>The death of the Canon, bereft of all and yet believing
himself to possess all, had epitomized his life.</p>

<p>Overhead, sounds and stirrings had begun, and
Quentillian softly let himself out of the house and
stepped out into the fresh chill of the morning air.
His eyelids were stiff and aching from his vigil, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
sudden, most unwonted tears filled them. He glanced
at the windows of the old house. A light still burned
in Lucilla’s, as though the nurse had been able to spare
no thought from her ministrations.</p>

<p>Lucilla, the finest and bravest of the Canon’s children,
had been broken on the wheel.</p>

<p>In the passionless sorrow that possessed him, Quentillian
grasped at the strand of consolation that he knew
to exist somewhere. It had been found for him once
before, by Canon Morchard.</p>

<p>He found it again, remembering.</p>

<p><i>Mors janua vitæ.</i></p>

<p>The Canon had proclaimed it, as a joyful certainty.
Approached far otherwise, Owen could yet proclaim
it, too, as the supreme and ultimate Fact to be faced,
of which the true realization would strike forever the
balance between optimism and pessimism.</p>

<p>He turned towards the entrance again, and as he did
so the blinds of Canon Morchard’s room were drawn
down, by a careful, unseen hand.</p>

<small>OWEN AND LUCILLA</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>(i)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was nearly a year later that Owen Quentillian
went to Torquay to see Lucilla Morchard, and asked
her to marry him.</p>

<p>Nothing in the occasional letters that they had exchanged
could have been regarded as in any way indicative
of such a <i>dénouement</i>, and for once Owen saw
Lucilla thoroughly disconcerted.</p>

<p>“But why?” she demanded, in a tone at once wistful
and indignant.</p>

<p>Her face was pale and lined, but her eyes had lost
neither humour nor sanity of outlook.</p>

<p>“Not for the only reason that it ought to be, dear
Lucilla,” he answered humbly. “But because of the
awful loneliness at Stear, and my own weakness which
makes me afraid of it. And a little because of your
sadness here, perhaps, but most of all because you are
the only person I know who can face facts, and <i>then</i>
be happy. It’s the most wonderful combination in
life.”</p>

<p>“You have faced facts, yourself.”</p>

<p>“And it has only brought me bitterness.”</p>

<p>She reflected for a moment and then said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“That’s true. But you won’t find your remedy in
marriage with me, Owen.”</p>

<p>Her voice held all its old crisp, common-sense.</p>

<p>“Are you staying to tea, because if so, my aunt will
want some warning. She is old, and fussy, and there’s
only one maid.”</p>

<p>They had met out of doors.</p>

<p>“Pray don’t let me cause any inconvenience,” he said
stiffly, offended by the irrelevance.</p>

<p>“It won’t be in the least inconvenient,” Lucilla assured
him kindly. “Aunt Mary likes to see people, very
much, it’s a new interest for her. Only it worries her
if the drawing-room fire isn’t lit, or there’s no cake for
tea. Things like that, you know.”</p>

<p>He hardly did know, so different was his own world,
and he could scarcely credit that Lucilla, the erstwhile
mistress of St. Gwenllian, could know.</p>

<p>“You’ve remembered, of course,” she said reflectively,
“that I’m several years older than you are?”</p>

<p>“What can that matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, certainly, if you’ve faced the risk
that it entails and are prepared to take it. But, of
course, that isn’t the only risk, Owen.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. Is this an acceptance, or a refusal,
Lucilla?”</p>

<p>They both broke into laughter.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Lucilla, stopping at a little gate
in a row of other little gates. “I’ll walk with you to
the station afterwards.”</p>

<p>She paused, with her hand on the little gate, and
looked at him.</p>

<p>“It’s only that we are—or we ought to be—past the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
stage of following a generous impulse and hoping for
the best. I—I don’t want either of us to bite off more
than we can chew.”</p>

<p>On the elegance of her simile, Miss Morchard
opened the front door of “Balmoral” with a latchkey,
allowing no time for a reply.</p>

<p>She left Quentillian in the tiny, red-tiled hall while
she went into a room opening out of it, that was as
obviously the drawing-room as the room on the other
side was the dining-room.</p>

<p>Quentillian looked round him, at the walls crowded
with foolish brackets and bad water-colours, at the
painted deal staircase and balusters, at the window on
the landing that looked out on to little back gardens,
all of exactly the same size and shape, and had a momentary
vivid recollection of the shabby, dignified
rooms at St. Gwenllian, and the old cedars close to the
tennis court.</p>

<p>Lucilla had been fond of gardening.</p>

<p>From somewhere in the basement came the screeching
note of a parrot.</p>

<p>Then Lucilla summoned him.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was exactly what he had expected
it to be, and so was the aunt.</p>

<p>She talked a little about Torquay, and explained that
she knew some of the residents, but none of the visitors,
unless there was “a link,” and she asked Owen if
he had read the life of Mary Slessor of Calabar.</p>

<p>He had not.</p>

<p>“You ought to read it. She was such a wonderful
person,” said the old lady with enthusiasm, and she
talked about foreign missions for some time, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
even this failed to enlighten the uninterested Quentillian
on the identity of Mary Slessor of Calabar.</p>

<p>Lucilla did not talk very much—but, then, she never
had talked very much.</p>

<p>The old aunt referred to her several times, and once
said to Quentillian: “My niece is clever, you know.
She reads a great deal. I like having an opinion to
go by, and she chooses my books for me so much better
than the girl at Boots’ lending library. So many
people just go by the name of a book, I fancy, but
Lucilla and I like to know something about the author
as well.”</p>

<p>She spoke with a faint air of justifiable pride.</p>

<p>Quentillian suddenly thought of the mountain of
manuscript concerning Leonidas of Alexandria, at the
laborious compilation for which Lucilla had worked
for so many years. He heard the oft-repeated tag of
which Canon Morchard had been fond: “Lucilla, here,
is our literary critic.”</p>

<p>A small, panting maid brought in tea, and the old
lady poured it out, and was very meticulous in inquiring
into Quentillian’s precise tastes as to milk and
sugar.</p>

<p>As soon as he could, he made his farewell.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll come again, now you’ve found the way
here,” said Lucilla’s aunt, kindly.</p>

<p>Lucilla, as she had promised, went with him, when
he left “Balmoral.”</p>

<p>They walked in silence for a little way and then
Owen said pleadingly:</p>

<p>“You’ll let me take you away from that, won’t you,
Lucilla? It’s an impossible life for you.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“Why do you confuse the issue like that? It’s just
what I said before—you want to follow a generous
impulse without counting the cost. My life has really
nothing to do with the question.”</p>

<p>He was frankly confounded.</p>

<p>“I thought it might be an argument in my favour,”
he said resentfully.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing that could really count in
that way—well, two things, to be accurate. Your need
of me, Owen.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite real,” he returned levelly. “I’m lonely,
and yet the company of most of the people I know
rather annoys me. And there’s another thing. I’m
frightened, very often. It’s since the war, and—and
you know I’d been shell-shocked, as they call it? I’ve
thought lately that if you were there—the realest person
I know—I shouldn’t be frightened, at Stear. I’m
giving you facts, Lucilla—not romance. We’ve both
missed <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“Val didn’t stand to you for romance, did she?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Quentillian could think of nothing at all to add to
his bald negative.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve faced your risks,” said Lucilla. “What
about mine?”</p>

<p>“The worst one is that you should find me an intolerable
egotist,” he said rather unsteadily.</p>

<p>“We can discount that.”</p>

<p>She spoke curtly, and he made no rejoinder, uncertain
of her meaning.</p>

<p>“What was the other argument that might count in
my favour, Lucilla? One was my need of you. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
think I’ve shown you that. But you said ‘two things,
to be accurate.’ Tell me what the other was.”</p>

<p>“Is,” she corrected, with a sound that was very
nearly a laugh, and that caused him to look at her.</p>

<p>She faced his gaze with all her own steadiness, but
for the first time he saw Lucilla’s mild imperviousness,
her implacable matter-of-factness, as a shield for something
infinitely fragile and sensitive.</p>

<p>Her voice, always quiet, was quieter than ever when
she spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s fair to tell you, I think. I’ve loved you for a
long time now. So you see my risks would be greater
than yours, Owen. That’s why I was afraid of impulse.
But you see I’ve told you this—which was
rather difficult to say—because it seems to me that our
one chance lies in absolute honesty. We’ve faced the
fact together that you’re—just lonely, and that’s why
you want me—but—we’ve got to face the other fact
too—both of us—I mean that, for me—you <i>do</i> stand
for romance, Owen.”</p>

<p>Her voice had not altered, but the effort with which
she had spoken had brought tears, that Owen had
never seen there before, to Lucilla’s eyes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she smiled at him valiantly.</p>

<p>For the first time, perhaps, since his childhood,
Quentillian found himself unable to analyse his feelings
or to translate them into tersely sententious periods.</p>

<p>In the long silence that fell between them, there began
a process by which he slowly reversed certain judgments,
and eliminated certain axioms, which hitherto
had stood to him for wisdom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>But it was with scarcely any knowledge of this, that
Owen Quentillian, reduced at last to making an appeal,
asked Lucilla Morchard once more:</p>

<p>“Will you marry me? The risks are all yours—will
you take them?”</p>

<p>With her most characteristic gesture, she bent her
head in assent, neither impulsive nor emotional, but
fully accepting responsibility, and said seriously and
gently:</p>

<p>“Yes, Owen, I will.”</p>
